dear Sir ,
I have seen your advertisement for a job on the internet and I am writing to apply for a summer job as an instructor and keeper of children in your camp .
I am working as a teacher in Spanish school with children aged between 8 and 14 .
I am an easy going person with a lot of empathy for children .
on the other hand , in my leisure time , I usually do sports like jogging or swimming , adventure activities like hiking , climbing or espe@@ le@@ ology too , for 20 years ago .
I have travelled around most European countries and I am able to understand , talk and write highly in three languages : Spanish , English and French .
it is the reason why I believe that I could be a suitable candidate for the job .
I would like to tell you I will be able to work in the months of July and August .
I hope it has not been involved in an inconvenience for you .
to the end , Could you please tell me what salary you are offering for his job ?
I look forward to hearing from you .

Hi . I am so happy to write here .@@ My favorite sport is riding the bike ( Bicycle ) .
it is a nice and good sport , especially when we try in the morning . it gives the body energy as well as regular work of the heart .
for me , I use this kind of sport for ten minutes daily .@@ I do this sport because I like it since I was a child .
my advice to anyone starting to learn this sport is to carefully avoid accidents , because it needs more concentration from the person to ride .@@ That is all .
thank you
I &apos;ve been studying English for several years , but I &apos;m not really sure what exactly my current goal is .
I &apos;ve been changing places and I do n&apos;t know which one is the best for me .
what I &apos;m sure about is the fact that I &apos;m going to need an official certificate in order to prove that I &apos;ve studied the language .
I study English because I love it and I &apos;d like to speak very fluently and watch a movie without subtitles .
I understand perfectly when a native speaker is talking but when I have to talk in English it &apos;s not so easy .
I &apos;m very motivated and I &apos;m going to continue with my studies , but I need to have clear where I &apos;m going .
I &apos;d like to teach the language to little children .
next year , I &apos;m going to focus on speaking and perhaps I will take a formal test .
otherwise , I &apos;d like to improve my grammar and writing so I &apos;ll keep on trying hard .
thank you for helping me .
the British par@@ li@@ am@@ entary elec@@ tor@@ al system is unfair and un@@ democratic .
it is , however , in my opinion , the best way for the basis of government .
consider a general election , in which three parties stand , X , Y , and Z , in a country of 5000 voters .
sup@@ posing 2000 people vote for party X and 1500 vote for parties Y and Z@@ . Party X would come into power because they had the most votes .
however there were 3000 people who did not want them to be in power , which is not the majority of the country .
also , the idea of each constitu@@ ency having an MP who fights for that constitu@@ ency &apos;s beliefs in parliament .
this has major flaws .
consider , for example , the MP who recently decided she wanted to change parties .
yes , I know it is the MP &apos;s belief that the constitu@@ ents are meant to vote on the ideas of that MP but this simply is n&apos;t the case in many circumstances . the vot@@ er votes on how that party for which that MP represents is doing at the moment .
once a party is in government it is free to do as it likes , changing its policies , until the next general election , at which point it will make hollow promises about what it will do when it next gets in power , just to gain votes .
it is , as I said before , the best system .
consider dictat@@ or@@ ships , this falls at the first hur@@ dle .
with this system any mad@@ man can control a country , having economic disasters for not only that country but other related countries .
there is no fair and perfect way to run a country .
one please some people some of the time , but not all people all of the time .
the only way a fair system of government can come about is in a group of about ten people at the most , and even then people are dis@@ content .
Hi Kar@@ ina ,
thanks for your letter .
of course I can tell you about D@@ ul@@ an .
he &apos;s 23 , and he &apos;s studying electronic engineering at Kel@@ ani@@ ya university and he &apos;s a second year student .
he has an elder sister , who has just finished her IT degree and now she is looking for a job .
his mother teaches biology science for advanced level students in An@@ anda College - Col@@ om@@ bo 10 and father works in Pe@@ op@@ les &apos; Bank as an assistant manager .
he &apos;s a cool , charming and very sociable person .
he &apos;s also sensitive .
when someone faces trouble , he does n&apos;t look at others and he goes forward to helping them as much as he can .
not only that , he &apos;s a responsible and reliable guy .
sometimes he borr@@ ows my personal thing@@ s@@ (@@ laptop , pen drives ) and gives me back on time as it is .
he &apos;s incredibly hard working .@@ that@@ &apos;s the secret behind his exams results .
he likes going out with friends , watching movies and listening to music - using his hi - fi headset , so do n&apos;t worry about no@@ i@@ se@@ !@@ He &apos;s a good rugby player and he plays for his university team@@ .@@ he@@ &apos;s crazy about computer games .
he had already finished many famous computer games when we left school , but he knows the limit and knows how to manage his studies without any disturbance .
he &apos;s keen on sports cars .
he has a large collection of pictures and videos about sports cars .
also , he has quite good knowledge of automobiles .
I know most of the time he does some repairs himself .
so it may be helpful for you during his holiday .
the only negative things I can think of are he &apos;s a bit untidy and not well organised .
his room is usually in a mess and sometimes he looks for his belongings for hours .
his English writing is very good , but he is n&apos;t a fluent speaker . I&apos;m sure he &apos;ll learn it fast .
finally I think he &apos;s really nice and that you and your family will get on well with him .
I hope the above information is useful .
let me know if you need more information about him .
love ,

a very important characteristic of the UK constitution , and one which is central to the question of sovereignty , is that it is the Westminster Parliament that is the supreme legal authority in the UK .
according to the orthodox school which subscri@@ bes to the views of Albert Ven@@ n dic@@ ey , the Westminster Parliament is om@@ nic@@ om@@ pe@@ tent and can pass laws on any subject it likes to regulate the activities of any person , anywhere , even those of aliens outside British territory .
in theory , then , the Westminster Parliament could pass a law banning smoking on the streets of Paris .
if our Parliament did so , British courts would be obliged to accept Parliament &apos;s decision and pass judgement accordingly .
of course , in practice , as the Radi@@ cal school ( who believe that the Westminster Parliament is not legi@@ sla@@ tively supreme ) point out , in this hypothetical situation , the P@@ ari@@ si@@ ens would take no notice whatever of the UK Parliament &apos;s legislation ; and Parliament would in effect be fet@@ tered .
dic@@ ey said that as each Parliament is omni@@ potent , and therefore has the power to make or un@@ make any law , no Parliament could bind its success@@ ors as to the content or manner and form of subsequent legislation .
the Radi@@ cal like to point out that since the passing of the European Comm@@ unities Act in 197@@ 2 , the Westminster Parliament has ce@@ ded its sovereignty and su@@ pre@@ macy to Europe .
the orthodox school re@@ tal@@ i@@ ated by pointing out that since Westminster Parliament passed the 197@@ 2 Act thereby putting the UK into the European Comm@@ unities , a future Parliament could just as easily repe@@ al this Act , and take us out of Europe again .
in this case , Britain would have re@@ tain@@ ed her sovereignty and Par@@ li@@ am@@ entary su@@ pre@@ macy .
of course , this whole question is still a subject of fierce debate .
British courts have avoided a head - on cl@@ ash by finding ambigu@@ ity in a domestic stat@@ ute and resolving that ambigu@@ ity so as to give effect to our Community obligations , or by finding that a stat@@ ute passed prior to the 197@@ 2 European Comm@@ unities Act is repe@@ aled by impli@@ cation by that Act and does not represent the latest intention of the Westminster Parliament or by arguing that subsequent legislation was in@@ adver@@ tant and that the Westminster Parliament could not have intended to come into conflict with community law .
in a recent development , the European Court of Justice ruled in the case of R v Secretary of State for Transport ex par@@ te F@@ actor@@ ta@@ me and others ( 1990 ) that courts in Britain must sus@@ p@@ end an Act of the Westminster Parliament where the rights of the citizens guaranteed by European Community law may be at risk .
this case for the first time said that it is a principle of UK law as influenced by the European Court that our Parliament is not supreme in every circumstance .
it would seem , therefore , that the advent of a single Europe is indeed meaning a loss of sovereignty for Britain , whatever the orthodox school may think to the contrary .
young people are interested in many things , like games , music , television programmes and the clothes they wear .
young people like children . they like to play games , listen to music , watch TV , wear special clothes .
now in 2015 the game that young people are interested in is speed stack .
in music they are interested in Taylor Swift songs because they are so wonderful even me hear them every day .
television programmes actually young people do n&apos;t like them but they like channels that have horror films , romantic films and films with happy endings .
this year there are fantastic clothes everywhere , especially in the U@@ AE .
dear Sirs ,
I am writing in connection with your job advertisement about the summer camps in the USA .
I am a twenty - year - old student from Poland and I am looking for an interesting job for the summer holidays .
I would like to apply for the job you are offering and I will intend to prove that I am an appropriate candidate .
in Poland I have been a Scout for ten years .
there I had various tasks , one of them was looking after younger children .
I helped to organise Scout camps all over my country .
we organised many sports and cultural activities .
apart from being a Scout , I also have been a lifeguard on kitesurfing camps in Poland .
I am not afraid of work in the kitchen .
I am also able to perform the harder tasks , such as washing the dishes or tidying up .
I believe you will consider my application ,
yours faithfully ,
XYZ
I beg to differ ; crime does pay .
many criminals live far better than the average American because they have chosen a life of crime .
being a criminal has its advantages ; you do n&apos;t have to worry about being fired , you can make more money in less time , you set up your own hours because you &apos;re your own boss , and you can retire well before the age of 65 .
let &apos;s take time to compare the criminal life to the life of the hard working person .
in our changing economy , any individual who holds down a job must be concerned whether or not he or she will continue to have that job .
many people are being laid off work or let go because the companies are no longer making enough profit to pay the employees .
a criminal will always be employed .
there is never a lack of work which is a means for continuing employment .
then if we think about the work day of most working people .
the average worker works 8 hours per day .
they make about $ 7.@@ 50 per hour for their labor .
this is $ 300@@ .00 per week before taxes and other deduc@@ tions .
tax deduc@@ tions will run about $ 69@@ .00 per week and deduc@@ tions for medical / dental insurance will cost them another $ 5@@ .00 per week bringing their actual take home pay to $ 2@@ 66@@ .00 per week .
the average criminal can work one hour a day and make $ 300@@ .00 without having to be concerned with deduc@@ tions for medical insurance and taxes .
further , the criminal does not have to be at work at a specific time for a specific number of hours each day .
the criminal is his / her own boss .
and finally , the one thing the criminal does have in common with the average worker is retirement .
however , the criminal can retire a lot faster than the worker if they ( the criminal ) have managed to save portions of the dollars they have stolen over the years .
if a criminal starts at age 15 and works only 5 hours per week until age 30 , he or she could be set for life .
at $ 300@@ .00 per hour over 15 years , the criminal earns $ 1,@@ 17@@ 0@@ ,000@@ .00 .
if he / she invest@@ s half this money and earns interest they could potentially live on the interest income alone .
comparing both options here , I &apos;d definitely say that crime does pay .
I was born in Thailand and have been living in Sam@@ ut@@ pr@@ ak@@ an which is a small city nearby Bangkok .
there are many types of transportation in Thailand .
I often take motorcycle , mini@@ bus , and finally with B@@ TS .
buses are a mode of transportation which I rarely take .
from my experience .
motorcycles are a very convenient mode of transportation .
it is the fastest transportation while you are in a rush .
even though it is needed in a hurry .
on the other hand , it is not very good safety .
motorcycles are the most dangerous mode of transport in Thailand compared with others .
even if we have a traffic rule , some riders still keep breaking the rule .
continuing with mini@@ buses , there are some rules for this type of transportation .
the drivers have to follow the traffic rules .
I found that it is good transportation which costs low prices and travels a long distance .
therefore , people in low to medium class prefer to use this mode of transport .
people who live around the city usually make appointments downtown .
because of a heavy traffic jam in Bangkok so they try to avoid other services .
then , B@@ TS is the best optional .
it is very satisfying with time and convenience .
people can manage their time easier because B@@ TS is fixed in time .
therefore , this mode of transport is the most predictable .
Thailand is a country that is not strict with the rule .
therefore , it can be heard news about accidents in the country .
customers and drivers are not disciplined .
my suggestion to those problems above is to start showing people how much priority of regulations are .
drivers , customers of even the police officers should be cooper@@ ated .

I am studying English Es@@ os@@ el enters 3 in the college and I can speak English very well .
I would like to deal with people &apos;s and I can speak many languages so well compared with people &apos;s .
I would like to work long hours on weekends because on weekdays I go to college and I am happy to work long hours on weekends .

humanity witnessed one of history &#91; recorded history &#93; most incredible minds at work when Albert E@@ insti@@ en came onto the scene .
although his theory &#91; his and his wife &apos;s &#93; was basically scientific in nature , it can and has been applied to all areas of human existence .
the theory I &apos;m speaking of is relativity .
with this theory also came the area of quantum mechanics .
it is difficult to conden@@ se this topic , a topic which has volumes , volumes a literature .
personally , I find that relativity hasn&apos;t had its full impact .
this is probably for several reasons : first , the notion that every point is a point of departure and that all other points are in reference to that point of departure is rather abstract .
it seems impossible and it leaves humans gras@@ ping for closure .
what E@@ insti@@ en did to humanity &apos;s philosophy was change the notion that closure could be obtained .
the Soc@@ ra@@ tic idea that all was known .
and that it was only a matter of time before a &quot; moment &quot; would reveal the knowledge from &quot; within &quot; was in effect shattered .
the philosopher &apos;s stone was pul@@ ver@@ ized into ut@@ op@@ ic and nos@@ tol@@ <eos> dust .
since it is my soci@@ alization that leads me to have a notion of earth@@ time &#91; 24 hours = day &#93; I think E@@ insti@@ en re@@ constructed part of it .
although I do n&apos;t claim to understand relativity , I &apos;ve attempted to ind@@ well the topic &#91; like si@@ d@@ ph@@ an@@ tha and his rock &#93; .
the point is my notion of time has changed ; And I think once humanity realizes that time - no@@ tions are human constructions and are subject to change , then the impact of E@@ insti@@ en &apos;s idea will be felt .
for now we are left with a world that has used E@@ insti@@ en &apos;s &quot; invention &quot; for intentions not worthy of the genius ; namely : atomic bombs .
the significance of atomic bombs can not be underestimated when speaking about humanity in the 20th century .
it set up a whole network of global systems .
USA - USSR ; with Japan and Germany as the &quot; winners &quot; .
cold wars ; north - south relations .
many things have been generated : namely fear !
relatively speaking , fear has been the main point of departure for global community construction .
this is a point that I think needs to be changed , from fear to peace .
a shift in focus if you will .
some would say this is too ut@@ op@@ ic ;
but if humanity sought to understand relativity ( as does Stephen Haw@@ kings ) our no@@ tions would be radically changed .
for now , we must deal with the short com@@ ings of humanity &apos;s use of E@@ insti@@ en &apos;s ideas : atomic weapons .
yesterday I went to a basketball clu@@ b@@ .@@ In my first training I scored 4 balls .
it was the first time for me to play basketball .
I think I was very good .
my dream is to be a basketball player . playing basketball is really fun and nice .
I loved playing it .
I want to play it again
it is undeniable that animals are vital to medical research for its merit benefits .
researchers could use animals ( such as mice and monkeys ) to examine the new drugs .
furthermore , animals probably used to determine the amount of dos@@ age .
these usages , certainly , identify whether the vaccine is functional .
in addition , it defines the maximum dos@@ age which is beyond the drug becoming lethal .
also , one of the most main purposes of using an animal in lab is that the anti@@ d@@ ote for its bite , for instance snakes , have to be extracted from their body .
even a bite could kill a person if a suitable anti@@ d@@ ote is not available .
writing about my favourite sport is talking about one of the best things in my life , since I &apos;m a sports fan .. and have been so all through my life .
while I was in high school I still recall d@@ reading the moment I had to go to Gym class but somehow later in life I discovered that sports would not just save my life .
furthermore , it became one of my favourite past times .
no matter what my mood was , putting on my trainers and finding a new place to discover ... possibilities became endless , parks , the beach , running tracks .
getting lost in the middle of the Woods ... anytime , any@@ place .
then , one thing led to the other and started roll@@ er@@ bl@@ ading , cycling , skiing or just going to the gym on rainy days totally changed my mood .
little did I know at that time that I would meet the man of my life thanks to sports .
to conclude I would like to leave a message to all those young people out there who do n&apos;t seem to fit anywhere .
taking part in any free time activity would help you become a better person .
you will learn to share , to compete , to lead a healthier life .
believe that the potential lies deep within you and that the sky is the limit .
as it said in the book &quot; Say it again See it again &quot; artistic research is quite complicated and a lot of time discussed topic .
in academic fields there is some question of how artistic research is related to the research in academic framework .
when we look it in the dictionaries what is research in academic study we read this definition :
&quot; the systematic investigation into and study of materials and sources in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions &quot; .
according to the UNESCO definition , research is &quot; any creative systematic activity undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge , including knowledge of man , culture and society , and the use of this knowledge to devi@@ se new applications . &quot;
another source said that research is searching for and gathering information , usually to answer a particular question or problem .
when we look for Arti@@ stic research .
it is said that artistic research is process of making artwork .
those two terms academic research and artistic research are mainly different from the result of the research .
in academic field after research we have some knowledge which can be gener@@ alised .
a conclusion of academic research becomes as the law which remains in time .
while in artistic research we work with singular knowledge which is unique .
and can not be really stay as a law or a long@@ - term statement . because of the experimental sense of the research , unpredictable , multi@@ disciplinary , creative character of the artistic research is difficult to define what artistic research really is .
also artistic research does not produce only knowledge .
it changes people &apos;s mind set .
artistic research is a research because artists look for knowledge in order to create artwork .
so in art research exist in artwork itself .
I have read in the book about artistic research that artists are doing their research without calling it research .
Mrs Kate Ashby ,
I would like to apply for a weekend job in Green Pepper Cafe .
I am tw@@ ent@@ y@@ one year old student .
food is the most important part of my life . it makes me happy .
I really like to cook for my friends , different kinds of dishes from all over the world .
I am used to working long hours , because last holidays I had a full - time job in a bar at the beach .
I am open - minded and full of smiles , a person who loves to meet new people and learn new things .
I think that I am a calm and friendly person , for me a satisfied client is a happy client .
I also know Spanish . it could be helpful to talk with tourists from Spain .
I hope you would like to meet with me and get to know more about my experience working in bars and cafes .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
with kind regards Clar@@ ita
watching &quot; Cu@@ é@@ n@@ ta@@ me &quot; might not be the first film you think of about the Spanish last century , but in fact there is a good example of our country &apos;s history at that time .
although it was shot last year by a young director , he has known how difficult life was , so it is more than likely he studied in detail society , customs , clothes or hair tr@@ ended because eldest say it is a thr@@ u@@ sh reflection of Spaniards life .
even more , it is said by pensioners that the movie makes them remind their young ag@@ es@@ - so it is a realistic film .
on the other hand , it is more than likely that they could be a bit sad , homesick , and maybe they could lose a tear too .
the movie would reflect the life of an average family with a toddler and two teenager children and the grandmother , who is always wearing black clothes because she lost her husband in the Spanish Civil War .
as the parents were working out she used to do the housework , taking care of her grandchildren .
on top of that , it is watching the beginning of the democracy age and how hard the birth of some Poli@@ ty parties and , of course , it is showing us how women begging to smoke , wearing skinny trousers or getting a driving license .
it was a strange change in this country .
to sum up , I strongly recommend this movie , not only for students or young people , but also for middle ages and eldest . in addition , it could be a great movie for foreign people , so they could be able to understand our History easily .
dear Mrs Ashby ,
I would like to work in the cafe at the weekend .
I have worked in a cafe many times before and enjoy meeting people . I have used Green Pepper Cafe many times and drink coffee there .
it was very good and the people working there were happy .
I want to work at your place as I am interested in many foods and I really enjoy meeting with people .
I also work long hours in a cafe before which I like .
please tell me soon if I have an interview .
schooling of the children &apos;s
I think children must be educated at school , not at home .
because at school they can deal with other people , learn from young how to deal with situations , with other thoughts and cultures , and learn about that stuff .
knowledge is not just what we learn to sit on a chair , but how to deal with society too .
does n&apos;t make any sense the person be very smart , intelligent , intellectual , know everything about so many subjects , if he ca n&apos;t express yourself , your ideas .
if he can not act naturally facing difficulties or staying calm dealing with the others thoughts , different of his ideas , demonstr@@ ating how flexible he can be facing difficult situations .
knowledge is a combination of the intellectual and emotion part of our brain .
it must be a balance between these two parts .
so , teaching the child alone at home is not a good idea for his development .
the advantage of learning the child at home is to see and follow exactly what he will learn , the time of study , seeing closely what the child is assimil@@ ating .
but , like I said before , it &apos;s very important to help them to deal with other people and situations since little &apos;s , to combine the rational and emotional part of their brains .
it &apos;s a hard decision for parents , more for those who want control all the aspects of the lives of their children , but it &apos;s necessary to understand how important a decision like that is to the future of those kids .
it &apos;s more important to keep control of everything or leave the child to learn from his experiences and develop other skills .
I like and really loved football .
I do n&apos;t know why ? I just love that . my favourite club is Real Madrid and my favourite players are K@@ aka and CR 7 .
I do n&apos;t care every time I watch my favourite club match .
through football I can see him .
he &apos;s my favourite player , most favourite than K@@ aka .
if I can watch his competition I &apos;ll watch it .
he &apos;s my spirit also .
I loved football since I was in 1st grade of junior high school . usually , I watched a football match with my father .
at midnight we &apos;re watching together ...
my lovely team is my Country Gar@@ uda Team . you &apos;re the best in the world .
my hope is the national football team of Indonesia could be a big team and the best team .
this idea is completely err@@ one@@ ous .
money , perhaps , is a necessary evil in order to conduct the daily affairs of life .
money , in some form or other , is required in order to carry out business trading , commerce and exchange of property .
money enables a human being to store what he owns , to pay for his expenses , to share with others or even to give to those in need .
however , it is true that the love of money is the root of all evil .
this is a different concept all together .
the desire for what we may not have can at times cause people to conduct themselves in a way that they might not otherwise do .
although there is a healthy desire to meet the needs that we have , at times this desire can be pushed to an extreme .
how many times have we seen on the evening news a family being broken apart , a company going under , or even a nation crum@@ bling simply because there was a desperate desire , on the part of one or many , for something that exceeds what was actually needed or required ?
even individuals can be destroyed who are in constant search of what ev@@ ades them .
they think that having the &quot; right &quot; car or living in the &quot; right &quot; neighborhood or knowing the &quot; right &quot; people can bring them happiness or content@@ ment .
this love of money ur@@ ges them on , causes them to neglect their families and at times to commit crimes for which they are imprisoned .
our society pays de@@ arly , both financially and socially , for their love affair with money .
it is a cross - cultural thing .
we can be speaking of the American dollar , the Japanese yen or the Spanish pes@@ eta .
the love of whatever represents the financial exchange between parties wre@@ aks ha@@ vo@@ c in a nation , a family and even an individual life .
not the money itself but rather the love of it persu@@ ades men &apos;s hearts , creates their minds and influences their priorities and their behavior .
the ho@@ ar@@ ding of wealth for personal benefit or security when pushed to an extreme is the root of all evil .
it produces selfishness in even the smallest child .
it &apos;s not long before a 4 - 5 year - old realizes the power that money brings .
he begins to hide it , save it , ask for it and spend it .
a healthy thing can be turned into a tool for disaster . is money the root of all evil ?
no .
it can be sued for good .
it can bring relief to those in need and even extra joy into a life that already has its needs met .
however , the love it , the overwhelming desire for it that causes people to overlook what is most important and at times even commit terrible acts toward each other , is truly the root of all evil .
history is the identity of people . it can tell the future generation about the past one .
as all nations and people have their own history and to distinguish this only by marks left .
historical places as well as archives are the most common thing showing ancient life .
every nation has its identity .
in my country there are a lot of historical places that refer to different civilization .
but the most place that attracts more people is the capital . we can call it the Car@@ ref@@ our of civilization .
different civilizations set up there from By@@ z@@ antine to french passing by O@@ tt@@ oman and others .
our attractive historical place is CAS@@ B@@ AH .
CAS@@ B@@ AH is a historical city and has an important story about building it .
I believe I am a good person for summer camp staff .
besides I grew up with two children , most children are very fond of me .
I always enjoy sports , especially basketball , tennis , and dance .
also I &apos;m good at cooking and reading books .
I hope you will select me as the job .
dear Isabel ,
my new town is so wonderful .
I really enjoy living here !
my town is near a lake and in between two bigger towns .
the main attractions are a historic museum and a very big indoor bath .
my favourite place in town is a bank at the lake .
I love to sit there and watch the sunrise .
best wishes from my lovely new home .
I live in a tiny village named F@@ als , where there are n&apos;t lots of people , there are only , more or less , one hundred people .
in my little village , most people are farmers and they do n&apos;t use too many cars or mot@@ o@@ bikes , they just use trucks and other things .
so I think that in my village we take care of the environment , because we do n&apos;t waste a lot of pollution , so I can say that I live in a healthy village about pollution .
but in my country we usually do n&apos;t take care of the environment , because people in Spain do n&apos;t think about each other , they just think about their own .
although most Spanish people do n&apos;t think about the environment because they say it &apos;s not the present , it &apos;s the future .
the childhood , nowadays , is really involved with technology .
most of the fun for children is video games , television , computers and tablets , where they play electronic games and watch movies or cartoons .
in this way , it is clear that television entertains and does part of our lives , but it can also educate if we have appropriate subjects .
for example , some cartoons with their characters can teach children count in other languages , resolve mathematics accounts as simple adds and the most important children can learn how to deal with their parents and their friends and learn what is wrong or right . in other words , television can influence their behavior .
on the other hand , television is common a lot of entertainment , which can affect some choices and will@@ s of the child as some kind of toy . soon he starts to ask this just because of the media .
therefore , it is very important that parents have knowledge of what their children are watching and learning on TV .
thus , television could be good for education , but the time in front of the screen has to be controlled . after all , childhood is also controlled by playing or in the open air !
it is apparently due to the huge improvement of the automobile industry which makes a better transport environment with dramatic transporting .
you can easily travel from A place to B place while step into a private car , which will create an electronic delivery lane and com@@ press the data of the car with the driver .
drivers just simply ign@@ ite the car engine , choose the destination with the accurate address , map the three dimension of street view and then drive .
in only five minutes , literally , you arrive .
with the new way of driving , people do not have to walk along a 500 meter road to public transportation like train stations , or bus stations , while buying modern cars which provide a better transport experience .
dear Ms. Kennedy

no doubt that all of us dream of living in a healthy environment which needs a lot of requirements from both the people and the government .
but in fact this has not happened 100% as most people are not committed to this as most of them always put the rubbish in the streets and not inside the place which they have to put in .
in the Village , the farmers always throw the ta@@ iling and the dead bodies of the animals in the canals , which dirty the water which they use in watering the farmland , and this leads to the pollution of the food .
as a matter of fact , there is enormous quantity of ways of transm@@ itting information , which always has been extremely important for people , especially nowadays .
we can receive it from old - fashioned , or traditional , sources of information such as books , and from contemporary types of media , for instance , from TVs and radio .
due to all kinds of sources having advantages and disadvantages , it will be considered some arguments to find the most effective .
actually , broadcasting activities are great opportunities to get the latest news about a situation in the world or the latest knowledge about the different fields of science ; whereas books can present obsolete or inadequate information .
indeed , scientists have proved that about a half of information in books has become outdated in 5 - 10 years .
in contrast , we can find that some data on the television and on the radio are deliberately distorted .
nowadays , there is an opinion that the media is the fourth estate , which can influence our consciousness .
it is too hard to disagree with it , when the information became a means of war@@ fare , but not the method of enligh@@ tenment .
then books come to the front as a means of history &apos;s cognition : all human experience , which cum@@ ul@@ ated during all time of human existence , is represented there .
in conclusion , I guess that we should not choose the only way of communicating information , as all types of media have pros and cons .
choosing the appropriate option for receiving certain data is a skill we should learn .
every year , there &apos;s a winter festival in my city .
this year , there were more activities than last year .
it was a great time to spend with my friends .
there were a lot of activities like snowboard , competitions and concerts .
there was a lovely activity for the kids called &quot; Do you wanna build a snowman ? &quot; where they spent an incredible time building snow@@ men .
I participated in a dance competition .
the judges said that I was an amazing dance and it was a very emotional moment for me .
I ca n&apos;t wait for the festival next year .
football is my favorite game because it is quite a challenging and interesting game . I began to play football when I was 6 years old .
since then it has become my passion .
it is also called &quot; king of sport &quot; and is the most famous sport in the entire world .
Hi ,
I &apos;m Ot@@ ta@@ via , I &apos;m 23 years old .
I was born in Gu@@ b@@ bio , a small city in the center of Italy , but now I &apos;m living in Turin , because I &apos;m studying here .
I saw this advertisement and I thought that it was the right job for me .
I &apos;m energetic , I &apos;m always smiling and I like meeting new people so much .
I love travelling , because I think that it is the best way to get to know new cultures and to open your mind .
I &apos;m a very creative person . I love organising activities , games and events .
when I was 15 , in my city in Italy , I looked after children in a summer camp organised by church .
so I &apos;ve yet experience in this kind of job .
definitely , I have done a lot of jobs , to pay for my studies .
I worked in a bar , in a pub , in a shop and as p.@@ r . in Italian discos .
I also did p.@@ r . in I@@ bi@@ za too .
I know very well the sense of sacrifice and the meaning of hard work .
so , I &apos;m ready to work hard , to have fun , to meet a lot of people and to live a beautiful and unforgettable experience !
I hope in a positive result .
bye .
dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to you to apply for the job you advertised in Summer Holidays Magazine as a volunteer in the USA summer camps .
I am 23 years old and I have just finished my studies in Teaching at the University of Seville .
after summer , I would like to work at a prestigious centre in Birmingham &apos; The Good She@@ pherd School &apos; so , learning from a summer camp in the United States of America would be a great opportunity for me .
as you can see from my attached Curriculum Vit@@ ae , I have been working as a nanny for two years , and I also have five little cousins that I had to look after on many occasions .
in addition , I worked in summer camps last summer where I was in charge of planning and leading games and craft activities .
being a leader made me develop a strong sense of respon@@ s@@ bility .
in addition , I am about to examine for the CAE ( Certificate in Advanced English ) in some weeks .
I love learning English . in fact I have some English exchanges with people who I talk to twice a week .
I believe a good teacher is someone who can entertain children , play with them and teach them how to improve their skills .
I think I have all these abilities and I am perfectly capable of doing this job .
I look forward to hearing from you ,
yours faithfully

there are several reasons why people in the UK might cease to eat beef .
for example , everyone may suddenly become vegetarian or tastes may alter in such a way that nobody in the UK wants to eat beef .
however , these occur@@ ances are at best unlikely .
the only plausible reason for people in the UK to cease to eat beef is the disease C@@ J@@ D .
this disease is the human equivalent of &apos; M@@ AD cow DIS@@ E@@ ASE &apos; or B@@ SE .
in recent years there has been a huge increase in the number of cases of B@@ SE .
this seems to be mainly caused by farming methods 20 years ago .
in the 1960 &apos;s and 1970 &apos;s , cows were given feed which included sheep ( and their brains ) in its ingredients .
many animals which ate this feed developed B@@ SE and even more passed it on to their young .
there is a belief among the people of the UK that eating beef is dangerous , as they believe that the B@@ SE can be passed on to humans when they eat beef .
there is no scientific evidence at present to suggest that this is the case .
however , cases of C@@ J@@ D and B@@ SE have been widely docum@@ ented in the media and this has greatly influenced people .
pictures on the television of cows with B@@ SE who are unable to walk properly and humans with C@@ J@@ D highlight how horrific and de@@ bili@@ tating a condition C@@ J@@ D is .
if the media coverage of C@@ J@@ D and B@@ SE continues in the same manner , it is not in@@ conceivable that people in the UK might be so scared that they cease to eat beef entirely .
if people in the UK were to cease to eat beef , the effect on the agricultural industry would be devastating .
cow farmers would fall in numbers by a huge amount .
this is because with the beef market destroyed , the only market open to these farmers would be the dairy products market which is not large enough to sustain many sellers .
the C@@ J@@ D and B@@ SE scare could even spread to dairy products and if this happened , cow farmers would cease to exist entirely .
however , when people cease to eat beef what do they eat instead ?
the answer is pork , lamb and other meats .
the increase in demand for the other meats would be approximately propor@@ tion@@ ate to the fall in demand for beef .
this would mean that producers of other meats would benefit from people c@@ easing to eat beef .
although cattle farmers could no longer remain in the beef market , they could switch from cattle farming to pig or sheep farming and stay in the agricultural industry .
the overall effect on the size of the agricultural industry would be virtually ni@@ l .
this is because the fall in the size of the beef market would correspond with a rise in the size of the other agricultural product markets .
this would mean that the structure of agricultural industry had altered greatly with the proportion of it taken up by the meats other than beef market growing .
dear sir or madam ,
I am writing with reference to your advertisement , which I saw in the magazine two weeks ago .
I would be very interested in this vacancy .
I am the president of Young Pi@@ one@@ ers club at a primary school , so I usually organize for students to have a picnic , go camping , play sports and outside activities as well .
in order to ensure safety for them , my school sometimes asks me to attend some first - aid courses , which gives me the confidence to deal with emergency situations .
particularly , I am free from June until September .
I am a native speaker of Vietnamese and I was awarded a B grade in First Certificate in English last year .
I consider myself to be energetic , humorous , enthusiastic and sociable .
I would do my best to make a success of this job and I hope you would consider my application favor@@ ably . I have enclosed my CV for your attention and I would also be glad to attend an interview at any time convenient for you .
yours faithfully ,

interestingly enough , this topic is one that is very important to me .
I often dwell on the characteristics of mankind that lead us to continually invent new things .
we seem to be somewhat obsessed with technology , and use it to dominate nature , as well as our fellow man .
technology and inventions seem to stem from our natural fear of death and our human in@@ securi@@ ties .
we attempt to dominate nature so that we may live without fearing death , and we attempt to dominate other people so that we may live without our petty in@@ securi@@ ties .
for these reasons , I would argue that the only inventions of the twentieth century that have significantly changed people &apos;s lives for the better are those that have occured in the medical field .
although these inventions do stem from a fear of death , they do not attempt to dominate nature nor other human beings as the majority of other inventions do .
they save lives .
by closely analyzing the nature of modern inventions , one notes a consistent trend leading away from a lifestyle that is peacefully co@@ exi@@ stent with nature .
we are ourselves a part of nature , yet we attempt to live outside of it .
we continue to destroy plants , animals , and the earth itself and our new inventions help us to do it in more efficient ways .
therefore , inventions in the 20th century have had , for the most part , a negative affect on our lives because by destroying nature , we &apos;re destroying ourselves .
in addition , our inventions are used to dominate one another .
we invent better weapons and better economic systems ge@@ ared for killing and depri@@ ving other people .
medical inventions , on the other hand , are designed to help people of all colors , and can not be used to dominate nature or other people .
they are one of the only truly &quot; kind &quot; expressions of mankind &apos;s creativity .
in modern society , especially regarding developed countries , traffic and all the problems related to it affect the socioeconomic conditions of the whole population .
many governments argue that these problems could be solved by increasing the cost of petrol .
to my mind , this should not be the right way to solve them but other measures need to be carried out .
in many overcrowded cities , like New York and Tokyo , the first cause of air pollution is the chaotic and un@@ controlled flow of vehicles which use fossil fuels to operate .
this trend will certainly rise in the future , due to the great number of people who are moving from the countryside to the city .
this phenomenon happens especially in developing countries , such as China .
however , an increase in fuel &apos;s price is not effective in reducing traffic flow .
indeed , over the last fifty years , this price has shown a dramatic boost but the air pollution continues to boost .
it can be seen in some virtu@@ ous towns , for instance O@@ sl@@ o in Norway , that encouraging people to use bicycles is an excellent way to reduce traffic and its consequences .
the said encouragement can be carried out by a decrease of taxes or other money benefits for those who ride their bikes instead of driving a car .
another way to reduce traffic is the enhancement of the public transport system , which is larger trains , more bus lines , etc .
in fact , many people prefer to travel by car because the trains are often overcrowded or due to the fact that they have to wake up early in the morning to catch the bus .
in conclusion , although increasing petrol &apos;s price could be effective in the short - term period , this measure can not reduce the use of fossil fuels and , so , the problem related to traffic .
however , better solutions can be found by making people aware of the benefits due to the reduced use of the car .
good morning ,
last week I travelled by air with your airline . the trip was good but I lost my luggage .
it is big , flu@@ o pink with blue lines .
I went to the staff to tell them about this situation . they told me to send an email to the company .
so I &apos;m writing to receive my luggage .
I hope that you could find it because it contains things very important for me .
write to me soon !

I &apos;m very pleased that you have taken into account .
I &apos;m an Italian girl . I &apos;m nineteen years old Ola and I live with my parents and my twins in the south of Italy .
when I was a baby I used to go to summer camps with my family . I grew up in a camp .
I think that I can be a suitable person for this job because now I look after my brothers , who are five years old , and I love cooking and playing with them ; I &apos;m growing up in the south and here in summer there are many summer camps , and usually I work in those so I have experience .
hoping to have satisfied your requests , I&apos;M waiting for your answer .
the people living in my town are not very environmental friendly .
they are not that way minded .
for example , when it is time to take the rubbish out , the T@@ own@@ hall sets a committed time for this task .
instead the citizens choose not to do it during this time but any other time they feel like .
I think this is not a very proper thing to do .
my teacher asked me about what I do in my free time .
I always enjoy playing video games and I usually do it at night .
I do it at night because in the afternoon I study . I enjoy doing it .
I hang out regularly with my friends and we enjoy ourselves a lot .
I think I am a privileged teenager .
in the past , people used to use public transport , and now people also use public transport , but at a lower rate than in the past .
in my opinion , that in the future very little people will use it and maybe no one .
to start with , all people will prefer using cars to using public transport .
this is because when people use public transport , this tires them from standing and waiting for a long time in a crowd .
also , having their own car will help them to go easily to any of the places they want without standing and waiting to find public transport to drive them .
furthermore , bikes and walking will replace public transportation .
this is because people are now caring for themselves and for their health .
so , they prefer using bikes to using cars or public transportation for their health and for saving the environment from pollution .
moreover , in the future public transportation may be banned to avoid the real harm of their toxic fumes .
besides , it harms the environment and this can cause ac@@ idi@@ c rains and global warming .
to conclude , public transport is not useful anymore .
I believe that they will end because of their harms , which is far more than its benefits .
drinking has been a custom in the U.S. for many decades .
every since the wild west , the civil war , and the dr@@ afting of the De@@ clar@@ ation of Independence .
people under the age of twenty one are considered to be minors , when it comes to drinking alcoholic beverages in the United States .
at eighteen you are considered a man , therefore you should be able to decide your own fate and make your own decisions .
eighteen should be the legal age to consume alcohol in the United States .
you can be condemned to go to war in the United States at the age of eighteen , but you can not drink a beer like all of the other adults over the age of twenty one .
kids are dying for our country in wars , but the government will still not allow them to drink .
how can you think you are a man and fight in combat , when the government says that you are two young to do what all of the other adults do ?
I think if you can hold a gun and fight for your country , you should be able to feel the effects of drinking alcohol .
kids are getting into too much trouble trying to hide their drinking from their parents .
most kids eighteen to twenty are out of high school , and their parents do not care what they do .
a high school diploma should state that you are old enough to make mature decisions .
you can say that some kids that are eighteen and over do not have a diploma .
you can make a rule that if you do not have a diploma and you are under twenty one , then you are not able to drink .
maybe a higher percentage of teenagers will graduate , thinking that if they had a diploma they would be able to do anything an adult can do .
there would be less crime in the United States among teenagers , if eighteen year old were allowed to drink .
most crime among teenagers is drinking and driving .
they are left with this decision to drink and drive because they try to hide it from their parents .
they can not drink in their own household , so they have to do it somewhere their parents would not find out .
eighteen year olds would not be put in jail for containing alcohol in the car either , which is another high percentage crime among teenagers .
drinking should be prohibited to kids eighteen or older .
if the government passes a law allowing them to drink , it would just make the U.S. a better environment to live in .
if anything , the military should convince the government to pass a law allowing teenagers to drink .
if they passed that law , I would feel more like an adult , and accept more responsibility because I am one .
the invention of the airplane , in my opinion , has drastically changed the lives of many people .
air transportation allows people to travel from place to place more quickly and effectively and overseas travel has been drastically affected .
without the airplane my trip from the U.S. to Spain would@@ &apos;ve taken an extraordinary amount of time , maybe a week .
the invention of the airplane has also affected areas other than solely ( vacation ) travel , business , entertainment , and inter@@ continental relations ( politics ) have also felt the impact of the airplane .
as I &apos;ve already said , the area of travel has been greatly improved due to the airplane .
travel times have been significantly shortened ; for example , driving from Michigan to California takes about 30 - 35 hours , but to fly the same distance takes about 3 hours .
this allows people a greater variety of places to travel , and they can spend their vacation time at their chosen destination , not trying to get there .
the business world has definitely flouri@@ shed due to the airplane .
as a result of the greatly decreased travel times , countries can work together much easier than previously possibly .
also , business relations within a country have improved .
today , it is relatively easy for an American busin@@ es@@ sper@@ son to have business relations in any part of the world .
I have seen this in the increase in International Business during the past few decades .
entertainment , a very large field , has grown with the invention of the airplane .
now , entertainers , whether they be musicians , actors , or athletes , can travel from place to place much more quickly .
for example , Michael Jackson just gave a concert in Madrid . this was made much easier because of the airplane .
professional athletic teams reduce travel time , and are able to play more games in many different places because travel is so easy .
the last area I &apos;m going to touch on is inter@@ continental relations .
this area has been positively and negatively affected .
positive aspects are those such as &quot; Peace Tal@@ ks &quot; between nations ; these would not take place as often as they do , if it took the President 1 week to get to where they were going .
also , heads of state can more easily interact with each other ( in their perspective countries ) with the use of air transportation .
there are negative aspects , too .
unfortunately , wars have used airplanes .
Japan bombing Pearl HA@@ B@@ OR , for example , and the U.S. dropping atomic bombs on Japan .
the invention of the airplane has had many positive effec@@ ts@@ - , unfortunately , it has brought about some negative changes , too .
nowadays , the number of cars is increasing and the number of public transport is reducing .
there are many pros and cons to using cars .
first of all , it is very useful .
you can drive anywhere and anytime .@@ Secon@@ dly , it is more economical .
there is an opinion that in any job discipline should prev@@ ail over talent .
to my mind , I would not even question the statement .
firstly , only regular constant self@@ development ( which needs great discipline ) makes a talent turn into a perfect skill in different professions .
any talent is nothing without discipline .
it is common knowledge that even the most gifted and talented musicians or ballet dancers , for example , never succeed without orderly hard work .
even ballet dancers are famous for their strict discipline .
secondly , even if a person does not have any obvious innate abilities , he or she can develop perfect skills ( provided discipline ) and become more impressive than a dis@@ orderly talent .
to add to this , the last World hockey championship showed how weak our Russian team ( stuffed with brilliant players ) was against less talented but more disciplined American team .
however , not all people share my thoughts .
they say if you are a genuine talent discipline it is unimportant because you already have talent and it is enough .
they also believe that talent is the only thing that matters in artistic professions and if you are not gifted , no discipline will help you .
I am afraid I can not agree with these people as I think discipline is more important than talent because only dow@@ ry is never enough , it needs support and day after day development .
as for creative professions , Pierre Car@@ d@@ in says that discipline and patience are in the first place for him .
I guess we can trust him .
to sum it up , you see the problem is tw@@ of@@ old and is a complicated one , but I still feel that discipline is the leading characteristic in any occupation .
well , my first impression is that : I absolutely disagree with the statement , because , in my mind , public transport is much more convenient than a car or almost all of the tips of particular methods for travelling , except walking or cycling .
the reason is simple .
travelling represents energy , then if you must spend energy , it is more economic and environmentally friendly if you can translate many people with the same energy .
also , you can use better energy sources and with much better profit from public transport than a personal car ( like electricity from solar or wind devices ) and then your level of greenhouse gases may be reduced by an important percentage .
on the other hand , you have a lack of comfort or worse or poorer availability for any dis@@ placement you need , but the advantages of public transport over private transport are more significant than disadvantages .
there were many objections raised against the introduction of the National Lot@@ tery when the idea was first proposed .
the main issue raised was unemployment that would occur in the pool company industry .
as the Lot@@ tery would sound more appealing due to the larger win@@ nings , greater public interest and the fact that it is easier to fill in than a pool coupon , less people would do the pool coupon , and this decrease in demand would mean that pool companies such as Lit@@ t@@ le@@ woods and Ver@@ non would be forced to make employees redundant due to a decrease in profits .
there were also problems raised about addiction and people younger than sixteen obtaining numbers .
when the National Lot@@ tery was introduced and also the scratch cards , many people became addicted to buying them . most of these people were unemployed or poorly paid and the Lot@@ tery represented a source of hope for future rich@@ ness . for many , this was not the case , and addiction meant large debts or resulting in violence and stealing to obtain extra money . it was argued that this addiction is on a par with drug addiction and just as hard to kick .
it was also argued that many people under the age of sixteen would buy lottery cards encouraging the whole nation and its youth to become compulsive gam@@ bl@@ ers , when money could be better spent on other products for instant on extra food for the family , or saving for a holiday or a car .
there were also objections raised to the amount of money the proposed jack@@ pot was to be each week and the idea of roll overs increasing this figure even more .
many people argue that the general public would not be able to cope with becoming overnight multi - milli@@ on@@ ai@@ res and the un@@ told pressure of fame on the front pages of a <eos> id and begging letters would make many people crack , and that they would never lead a normal life ever again and lose many friends .
finally the lottery was thought to put less money into charity collection boxes as everyone would prefer to put their last pound on a lottery card than in a collection box .
despite this , after a year of the National Lot@@ tery , there are many cases put forward for retaining it .
the main case is the amount of money that goes towards research ch@@ arities . this was not the case at the start but was introduced later . also grants are given out to preserve our great countries heritage and culture . for example , extensive work to repair an existing art gallery .
also many sporting projects receive grants to build more recreational areas for the youth and public to express themselves and get them off the street and deci@@ pl@@ ine them .
another case for retaining it is the fact that people are still prepared to buy a ticket , and if the demand for a ticket is there , there is no reason why the supply should not be also .
it gives people hope and something to look forward to during the week .
it has also increased the profits of many news@@ agents throughout the country as they get a small percentage of the money for each ticket sold .
there has been a liter@@ al explosion of inventions during the twentieth century ranging from the garbage disposal to the A - bomb .
some were created to make one &apos;s lives easier , others to make our lives longer , all were created for the purpose of advancing civilization .
while each one of these inventions has affected our lives in one way or another , some stand out as more significantly changing our mode of living .
perhaps one does stand out a little more among its competition , however ; that is the television .
before the late 1940 &apos;s entertainment , news , and information eventually all came through newspapers and radio .
a system that seemed to work , many households throughout the nation owned or had access to a radio and or newspaper where they could get the day &apos;s information easily and completely .
and , in the case of the radio , everything was almost immediate .
description of sporting events , voices acting out stories , persons of the government speaking directly to the people , the radio seemed the perfect solution to countries with its citizens living at all ends of their boar@@ ders .
the advent of television changed all of that , however , giving the public a &quot; peak &quot; at what radio was n&apos;t able to give them .
along with the news and information the radio brought to the homes of the people of the world , the television was able to add imag@@ es@@ - pictures that enhanced the entire absor@@ b@@ tion of what was being broadcast .
where once a reporter &apos;s voice described a scene , now the people could see for themselves what was happening because , for the most part , it was happening in front of their eyes .
besides the obvious higher level of enjoyment television watching may bring its viewers , the most important aspect of this creation is its ability to bring the worlds together .
a president of one country can be seen and heard in a country far away giving his views and ideas so that all can &quot; understand &quot; him .
the small town store owner can watch her son in his Olympic race as it &apos;s happening without sp@@ ening thousands to travel to see him in person .
the examples could be endless .
the television strength must be realized , however , as it does have the power to reach so many and persuade so many more .
it is a mul@@ tim@@ il@@ lion dollar business that has developed into even more fac@@ ets of media which has become a significant part of our lives .
it is a power we should be thankful to control as long as we do just that , control it .
we can make television work for us in medicine , politics , education , and so much more , so it is necessary to remember to keep the vision on television .
in Brazil , the place where I have lived since I was born , we have a culture of practicing soccer .
in my country , soccer is the preference of almost all people .
today , my country is receiving the FIFA World Cup .
it &apos;s the second time Brazil receives the World Cup event .
the last time was in 1950 , when Brazil lost the finals to Uruguay in a full Mar@@ ac@@ an@@ <eos> .
millions of people expect Brazil to win the World Cup .
environmental Prob@@ lems
what will the future be like in 30 year &apos;s time ?
we think that the planet will be in very bad conditions and the trees will disappear in 20 or 30 years because of deforestation . humans will be having more wars because the water will disappear .
after that the poles will melt totally because the temperature of the sun will become crazy and very hard so some people will have died of diseases , for example cancer .
the air pollution will be to the extreme because cars will be flying through the streets and the technology will have totally changed .
also in 20 year &apos;s we &apos;ll be eating more fast food and our anatomy will have changed .
so ... before all this becomes serious , we must begin to take care of our beautiful world .
for sure , travelling by car is more convenient but otherwise I do n&apos;t agree with the first statement that says there is no longer a future for public transport because of too many reasons . first of all , that the cost wise secondary the population requires more uni@@ fication other than before in order to reduce environmental violation and to save our planet . also , to enhance the chance to build a good relationship between humans in public transportation , we need to improve the vehicles that provide the services either buses or train stations .
dear TOEFL Staff . I am writing about your email concerning my TOEFL IB@@ T Test .
I decided to take the TOEFL IB@@ T Test to apply at Copenhagen University , and indicated U.@@ K. only as an option , but it is not my first choice .
can I take the test anyway or I have to delete my reservation ?
I look forward to hearing from you soon
abortion is a controversial topic in today &apos;s society .
almost everyone has an opinion on the subject .
many people believe it should be illegal .
many others believe the government should not interfere ; it should remain the choice of the individual .
H@@ ap@@ e@@ o pover@@ ty@@ g personal choice and illegal abor@@ tions are examples why people should maintain their right to decide .
abortion is the right of the people and it should remain so .
one in four women experience rape or attempted rape in their life time .
imagine being forced to carry the child of a man who assa@@ ulted you and then being forced to give birth to this child .
would be able to love him or her ?
this traumatic event takes months or years to recover from .
without the right to an abortion , many of these women would require more time to recover and more counseling that they would already be receiving .
most unwanted pregnancies occur in poverty stricken areas of society .
generally children born into im@@ pover@@ i@@ shed environments remain at that socioeconomic level their entire life .
lower income families also tend to have five children on average , while middle and upper income families tend to have only two children .
by offering abortion to the lower income people you are helping to maintain a balance of the number of@@ - lower income families and middle and upper income families .
women deserve the right to have an abortion . they won this right in the case of R@@ owe versus Way .
this was a landmark victory for pro - choice women across America .
without this case women would probably not be able to make the choice today .
no one should be able to decide whether or not another person should be allowed to have an abortion .
this includes religious people and the government itself , because if they remove this right who is to say they will not try to remove other rights eventually .
if abortion were to be out@@ law@@ ed again would this end the practice &apos; ?
not many women would continue to seek abor@@ tions whether it be by some un@@ sanitary underground &quot; clinic &quot; or on their own with some pri@@ mitive tool like a coat hang@@ er or similar device .
abortion would still be rampant but now it would have a much higher mortality rate and it would be more expensive .
without abor@@ tions where would all the unwanted children go ?
the basic plan would be to put them in adoption homes , but this would cost tax payers huge sums of money to support them .
the average cost to support a child is one hundred twenty - five thousand dollars for ei@@ ght@@ teen years .
infant mortality rates would sky racket als@@ op because there would be a higher rate of ignorant and un@@ caring parents .
the Education system between Iraq and Australia
there is a big difference between Iraq and Australia in education or study system , and this stems from the learning styles as will show :
• In Iraq they still prefer the old learning styles , the school giving the basic knowledge dependent on the curri@@ cul@@ a and at the same time they foxes to the homework , but in Australia they care more about the in direct educate through the song , painting , story , and they do n&apos;t care about the homework because they do all their duty in the school .
• I think the parents in Iraq care about their children &apos;s result more than her in Australia because the level of education in Iraq determines their <eos> ine because the Ira@@ q@@ is people prefer formal jobs rather than free work .
• Bo@@ the Ira@@ q@@ is an Australian believe the knowledge gained through education and it is not
Hello , my name is Luci@@ o and I am from Mexico City .
nowadays , the environment is in problems around the world , especially in my city , as it is one of the biggest cities in the world , so four years ago I took the decision to do some to save natural resources .
the first thing that I do every day is to put a bucket behind me to collect the water that is wasted and then it is used to wash the yard .
the second thing that I do is to have energy saving bulbs in all of my house . with this action , the com@@ t@@ ami@@ ation in case my house is minimum and the last thing that I do is to close the faucet while I brush my teeth .
I can do more in favor of the environment , but at the moment I stay comfortable with the actions that I take every day .
travelling by motorway today is not as easy as it was meant to be by any standards , yet every morning and evening motorways across the United Kingdom are blocked solid with traffic to and from work .
not only is this &apos; ec@@ ologically &apos; un@@ sound , due to the harm@@ full by@@ products of the combustion engine which has been stressed in the press recently , but it is also stressful , time wasting and expensive .
earth has a fin@@ ite supply of fossil fuels from which petroleum and diesel for our cars and trains to run on , but &apos; we &apos; have a need to get to work which could be anything up to 200 miles away .
not only are there problems with traveling from A to B , but the likelihood is that if B is any major city , you will waste more time looking for somewhere to park there .
during the pre - war Britain rail was the only means of long distance travel within the UK and so the rail system was more efficient with more frequent trains and many more stations , but as the motor car became more popular less people used the rail road and the system declined , the smaller demand has led to less frequent services at an increased price .
in my opinion , the only way forward is the increased use of public transport systems because of the sheer waste caused by the adver@@ age two - car family .
the majority of the cars that you will see whilst travelling at a &apos; snails &apos; pace a long the M@@ 6 outside Birmingham will be driven by one person with no passengers . if these drivers had offered to give a colle@@ gue from work a lift home , the numbers on the road would effectively be hal@@ ved .
cities such as Manchester have tried hard to control the increasing numbers of cars by introducing by - passes and providing multi - storey car parking .
some cities have even banned cars from entering the city during work hours , making pedestrian life enjoyable .
trams have been established in some cities , allowing people to leave their cars to do their shopping .
this , in my opinion , is the attitude that should be adopted not only by town and city coun@@ ci@@ lls but by the government to reduce the number of cars on the road .
it was like her first day at school .
she stood before the great building and started searching for a clue which could help her overcome this feeling of uncertainty , desper@@ ation and terrible curiosity that invaded her .
what was required of her ?
how was she supposed to reach an agreement and establish a settlement with those beings which looked so much alike humans but were not in the least similar to any other person she had ever known ?
they were not animals , they were not machines , they were not autom@@ ats but they were ready to use her and give her back empty , with neither soul nor mind .
she was there to negotiate the end of the war .
she was alone and there were millions .
they had cre@@ pt un@@ noticed .
a whole and soon to be lost civilization was fighting to survive and their future was in her hands .
they owed her everything , and therefore they had admitted to receiving her , but would they listen to her words ?
she knew she would just say lies , lots of lies , millions of lies , just as there were millions of beings with a reason to fight back : surveillance .
as she climbed the ruined stair through the debris and fil@@ thin@@ ess , there were still some pieces of cor@@ p@@ ses remaining nearby and the smell was so disgusting she thought she would pu@@ ke any time .
her watch showed 13@@ :@@ 13 h , that was a good hour , as good as any other .
the sun was shad@@ owed by a dark rose dust .
in today &apos;s society , it is unrealistic for one to expect to work for a single company or employee for the enti@@ re@@ ty of their life .
this essay explains this statement from three perspectives : economic , soci@@ ological , and legal factors .
workers do not gain financial benefits to the maximum if they work for a single company for a very long time . intending to attract more competent workers , companies tend to pay more to people who move in from another company .
in Japan , for example , many workers conduct job hunting after spending several years at a company in order to get a better job at another company .
except for those whose prime motivation to work is not money , one needs to think of working for several companies to get a better life .
one will be constantly exposed to de@@ grading opinions from the society if he / she stays at a single company for the enti@@ re@@ ty of their lives : some societies consider people who do not change their companies less competent .
again in Japan , because there is a social norm that competent workers constantly change their jobs in order to get a better job , some people tend to see those who stay at a single company as having no competence and being less ambitious .
being very sensitive to how other people see us , we are less likely to work for a single company for a very long time with such a social standard today .
companies gain more benefits if they hire new employees in a short period .
some countries command a company to hire an individual as regular worker if they work over a specific number of years .
in Japan , for example , with the intention of securing jobs for the youth , companies are required to hire part - time workers as regular , full - time workers after the workers work more than four years .
this has been burd@@ ening some companies that are hiring only part - time workers for the sake of personnel costs : many companies , as a result , do not renew a work contract for more than four years .
again , it is unrealistic for a worker to work for a single company for the rest of their lives .
everything happened three years ago .
his father was very angry with him because Michael was n&apos;t the person he had been .
Michael came back very late one night .
he was going out with people who were a bad influence on him .
they were drinking every night and they were out of control .
that day Michael &apos;s father talked with him and gave him one last opportunity to change .
at first , Michael was out of control .
he started yelling at his father , hitting the furniture , so he was unable to hear what his father was saying .
Michael decided to leave because he did n&apos;t want to cause anymore problems , but it was too late .
if his father had understood why Michael was acting this way , Michael &apos;s father would have punished him severely .
so , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Hi Isabel !
where are you Now ?
what are you doing at this moment ?
I &apos;m in Oxford , United Kingdom , with my best friend and we are visiting the city .
now is my new city and I love it .
Oxford is a fantastic and old city in the UK .
there are many shops of any type .
my favorite is top@@ shop . it is a shop for clothes and I like everything .
here there are many interesting universities .
the food is n&apos;t good . I miss Italian food .
with lovely A@@ le
dear Phil@@ lip ,
I &apos;ve gotten your letter and respond to you as soon as possible as I can .
you seem to be very upset due to these two interests .
I think you should n&apos;t give up any things you love .
they may exhaust you and give you no time for taking a break .
I had been through this during my high school life , so I can totally understand what you &apos;re thinking .
I would rather give you some advice as to taking advantage of your time .
it &apos;s better to schedule your daily events , which can shorten your wasting time , like surfing the Net or watching TV@@ .@@ If you are still tired off , try to take a rest .
it &apos;s fine for a time out but not for a give up .
I&apos;m pretty sure it will work if you are willing to have a try .
cheer up ! I will always be on your side .
Zumba , A HE@@ AL@@ TH@@ Y AND F@@ UN@@ NY SPORT
if you want to keep fit , you must dance z@@ umba .
actually , z@@ umba is one of the sports that you can find in all gym .
it is a sport in which people move all the body since they dance different kinds of music .
usually , one session of z@@ umba lasts around 60 minutes in which you can burn 600 calories more or less .
also , you do exercise and , at the same time , you are fine .
moreover , to practise z@@ umba is an opportunity for meeting other people and making new friends .
it is a sport that all people can practise : children , women , men ... as well as it is considered as a sport that makes happy people because they learn a lot of difficult dances , can see changes in their bodies , look healthy and thus , their self - esteem improves .
if you do z@@ umba three times a week and you follow a healthy diet , you will lose weight and you will feel better .
furthermore , I would like to advise that before each session , you must warm up the muscles to avoid any le@@ sion or problem . you have to begin with careful because there are very quickly songs and you can do damage .
also , you will need a lot of water for drinking .
on the other hand , if you feel tired , you can rest some songs .
to rest during a song is better than trying to dance all songs and end up injured .
in addition , after each session , you may stretch the body very well and thus , the next day you wo n&apos;t feel the horrible sti@@ ffs .
you have to practise z@@ umba because it is very funny . you will be the king or queen of discos .
my city is not good at transport .
we have only buses and the system is n&apos;t good .
they are late and there are very many people@@ .@@ b
the politics should invest much money in the system to better it .
if the politics use more correct money , the situation will be very better .
unfortunately , I can not say that my city is really nature - protective .
the city is quite clean , but all garbage is transported to sc@@ rap@@ yards and stored there .
some of it was burnt down , but most of the garbage remains forever .
well , not forever maybe , but garbage remains on collec@@ tors for an in@@ definite time .
several years ago in my city , special garbage containers appeared .
these containers have several sections for different types of garbage .
but when the container became full , the dust@@ cart operator poured all garbage into the same trunk !
so naturally , people were not happy to see that , and less than a month all those containers were abandoned .
the next major problem with environmental protection is industrial waste .
there &apos;s a river in our city which is heavily pois@@ oned with industrial pollution .
today all factories have fil@@ tering systems , but our river is still forbidden to swim in .
nevertheless , I &apos;d want to say that our city is changing .
these changes are not running fast , but they are in progress .
I hope that in a couple of years I &apos;ll be able to say that the city is really clean .
people have always seen themselves as social animals , with living together as the norm .
family life is one of the outline of how we understand ourselves and our relationships but also the way we build our places to live .
in this essay I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different generations of one family living together in the same house .
in my opinion , there are more advantages but the worst thing , which can happen , is the generation gap ( one of the reasons why relationships between teenagers and parents or grandparents can be difficult sometimes ) .
on the other hand , there is nothing better than getting on well together , especially with people you can rely on and trust .
they are your family , you are sharing your time and space with them , so if you feel involved , your life will be easier .
all you need is good communication skills and empha@@ ty .
you can help each other when necessary , ask for a piece of advice and be able to take part in reas@@ oned discussions .
there are some ways to prevent problems , ways to avoid upsetting each other .
it is important to keep an open mind .
when we act like that , we will find that all of us do n&apos;t just survive but thrive .
finally , family living should be nur@@ tured and supported by all family members because unity is our strength .
good D@@ EE@@ D
it was a nice Saturday night in Madrid .
I was in Pl@@ en@@ il@@ uni@@ o with my friends when I was 15 years old .
when we were leaving the shopping center , I unexpectedly found a really weird handbag . I was shocked due to the situation .
finding a bag with jewelry is not a mun@@ d@@ ane situation .
when I took the bag in order to see if there was any document or something that helped me to find the owner , my friends were turning a blind eye on me .
I quickly took the bag and left the shopping center sur@@ rep@@ ti@@ ti@@ ously while I was looking forward to my friends .
as I could n&apos;t find them , I directly went home as if nothing had happened .
when I reached my bedroom I saw that the exotic boxes I thought they carried jewelry actually carried banknotes .
I actually thought it was a dream , when I re@@ acted I had been 2 minutes as quiet as a mouse .
what should I do ?
I take the money and make if nothing has occurred or I try to give the bag back ?
finally , my regrets convinced me of doing a good deed .
researching for something that would help me to give the money back , I found the number of someone we actually were going to meet when I found him on the street .
it was my neighbour !
I gave him the bag and , proud of myself , I went back home thinking about what would have happened if I , selfishly , had kept the money .
the question of a single Europe and whether this implies a loss of sovereignty for Britain has been one of considerable debate for some time .
last November , one of the principal reasons underlying Mrs Tha@@ t@@ cher &apos;s resignation was her negative stance against increasing involvement in Europe .
her views were not shared by many of her party colleagues who , on the contrary , were conscious of an all too pressing need for Britain to play an active role in a united Europe .
January 1993 is expected to witness the creation of the single European Market .
the aims of such a union are essentially economic .
all trade barriers will be broken down so as to encourage and promote free trade between the countries of eur@@ ope , in the belief that increased cooperation will lead to increased productivity .
in order to facilitate trade between the different nations , many people are in favour of adopting a common currency , namely the EC@@ U .
this in turn would also have to lead to the formation of a central European bank .
a single Europe , whilst primarily being created as an economic union , will necessarily have implications on a political level .
the European Parliament of course already exists , but many people en@@ vis@@ age that in a single Europe it will play a more important role and its power will be extended , possibly sur@@ passing those exercised by individual national governments in Europe and over@@ riding decisions made by them .
for supporters of a single Europe , the question of whether it will en@@ tail a loss of British sovereignty is not a primary issue . they would argue first and foremost that Britain can not afford to go it alone and that it is in her interests to join forces with the rest of Europe .
critics of the European union , on the other hand , are afraid that increased cooperation in both the economic and political spheres will give rise to a European super@@ power which will under@@ mine the sovereignty of Britain in these fields .
personally , I am in favour of a single Europe to the extent that I believe Britain can no longer afford to stand alone in opposition to the other countries in Europe , all of which have long been in favour of such a union .
moreover , closer cooperation will undoubtedly be favourable and bring about increased productivity and prosperity .
however , I feel hesitant at the prospect of a common currency , at least until the time when such a move might become necessary , as this would certainly mean the loss of British sovereignty from an economic point of view .
yet I am even more against the idea of listening to political dict@@ ates from Brussels .
if the powers of the European Parliament are extended to the point that it has authority over national governments , our whole democratic political structure will be in grave danger and Britain will as@@ sure@@ dly lose its political sovereignty .
academic culture differs from one country to another , so it is the most important and challenging task for international students to adjust to the academic culture of Australia for effective learning .
during my study , I found a vast difference in academic culture between Nepal and Australia .
in Nepal , memor@@ ising lessons and r@@ ote learning is the basis of higher education .
in contrast , in Australia students are supposed to use online resources for research , refer@@ encing , study independently and think critically .
at the beginning , I felt really uncomfortable to use online resources , difficult to develop my own perspective and present a reas@@ oned argument .
however , studying in Australian academic culture is an incredibly exciting and rewarding experience .
there are definite reasons for the difference in academic culture of Nepal and Australia .
in Nepal , university teachers hardly get training , orientation and research opportunities to update their knowledge so they stick with the traditional method of teaching .
( T@@ ei@@ j@@ l@@ ingen , E. &amp; Sim@@ k@@ ha@@ da , P. ( 2010 ) .
as a result , the students fail to access research literature despite their strong academic success .
on the other hand , in Australia , courses like EAP are usually designed to improve students &apos; academic language proficiency and the relevant study skills which will help them throughout their academic life .
( Bud@@ ley )
thus , skill based learning is more useful in our academic life .
in conclusion , for my effective learning at my university , I will access available resources for my research , improve note taking skill , interact with teachers and peers in the class , attend class lecture and work hard to be an independent learner .
amongst recent issues , there have been big problems caused by the number of heavy goods vehicles on British roads today .
this amount of traffic on the roads causes mass congestion on motorways such as the M@@ 25 in London and the M@@ 61 in Manchester . this static movement on British motorways has caused an increase in gas emissions from car exhau@@ sts into the atmosphere , which will eventually cause global warming .
a few suggestions have been made to remedy these problems but with no great effect .
a number of these are listed below .
an allowance of better access into Britain &apos;s main industrial centres buy the building of large and substantial highways .
a limited number of H.@@ G@@ .@@ V. operators , only submitting a few lorries off their fle@@ et to be used on British roads .
a kind of cat@@ ay@@ li@@ tic conver@@ ter for diesel engines to reduce some of the harmful emissions .
another idea is for the government to introduce some type of to@@ lling system to be used on motorway and main A roads .
a final approach to the problem of congestion on motorways is to make Heavy Goo@@ ds transport compulsory for rail only .
here are only a few suggestions on how to convert British roads , but just these few would be cause for debate .
the problem with these suggestions is that it would cost millions of pounds to put any one of them into practice .
take the first suggestion . for example , a network of routes into all major industrial cities would cost billions due to the fact that it costs £ 1@@ million for a mile of motorway .
if there were only a limited number of H.@@ G@@ .@@ V. operators it would drive alot of people out of business and that would n&apos;t be in the best interest of the government .
a cat@@ ay@@ li@@ tic conver@@ ter for diesel engines is a good idea but it would only reduce gas emissions and not congestion .
all the suggestions I have made have problems and this is why we still have problems on our roads today .
dear Sirs and Mad@@ ames ,
my name is E@@ dd@@ a Pre@@ u@@ ß , I am from Germany and I finished my A - levels this year .
to get some new inspiration and some new ideas what I would like to do in the future , I planned to do a read trip through the USA .
but my plans suddenly changed when I read your advertisement for the job at the summer camps .
I am a very open - minded person .
I love to travel and to explore different cultures .
furthermore , I do many sports , such as swimming , running and dancing Flam@@ <eos> , Zumba and Hip Hop .
I have already worked with children in the past as I was working as a swimming teacher for children from 4 to 7 years and also as I was doing an Internship at a primary school in my town .
I loved to organize all sorts of activities , parties and meals .
I hope you share my opinion of being the perfect employer for the job you offer .
I am looking forwards to meeting you personally .

dear Madam / Sir ,
I was pleased to see your report on municipal waste collection released recently , as I have long been interested in the data you published .
it was also great to see that the percentage of land - filled waste is lower compared to other regions and I was particularly glad to see that the utili@@ sation of waste to recover heat and power has at least been started even if its proportion is still negligible in the overall treatment of waste .
it is my firm convic@@ tion that the proportion of recycled waste needs to grow during the coming year@@ (@@ s ) by shrinking the amount of land - filled waste quantities - to avoid the detrimental effect this latter has on the health conditions of the local population .
due to this I would like to propose that you involve locally based companies in decision making , since they are likely to have a stake in maintaining a clean local environment while eager to utilise recycled raw materials for their manufacturing processes .
it is imperative that you take my proposal into serious consideration , because the growing number of illnesses caused by toxic waste in the soil increases the municipality &apos;s social security expenditures , while ruining the lives of local families .
yours sincerely ,
Car@@ lo Pa@@ ole
genetic manipulation has been going on for many centuries in the form of selective breeding , both of crops and animals .
this technique has been of great benefit to the human race , enabling the production of more food , better food and new and interesting varieties of food .
of course , it is not just food that has benefited from selective breeding - the development of different natural fi@@ b@@ res such as wool and cotton has been aided by it .
it is only in very recent times that genetic manipulation has been seen to have bad as well as good sides .
this is because we are now at the stage where scientists can alter an organism by changing its genes in some way .
I do not believe that the scientists who originally began research into the nature of genetics had any idea that it would one day be put to bad ( or good ) use - they simply wanted to find out what it was all about , and hence can not be blamed for any later events .
today , much research is being carried out on human genes to find out how they work , and whether they can be altered to prevent diseases .
the scientists who work on this can not be blamed if someone else uses their technique for less phil@@ anthrop@@ ic ends - for example , in biological war@@ fare , or to eli@@ man@@ te a &apos; gay &apos; or &apos; criminal &apos; gene which may be present in human embr@@ y@@ os .
where scientists can be blamed , however , is in the case of genetically engine@@ ered tomatoes .
these are now available in a supermarket near you , with their genes altered to increase their re@@ dness , ju@@ ic@@ iness or resistance to disease .
these tomatoes are probably perfectly safe , but if they , or some other gen@@ ically engine@@ ered food , prove to cause a terrible disease , then that is the fault of the scientist who developed them , because they did not test them adequately to make sure they were safe .
similarly , if genetically engine@@ ered vaccines or me@@ dec@@ ines prove to have harmful side - effects , that is because they were not adequately tested before being released into the market , and the scientists are to blame .
to whom it may concern ,
I am writing this letter because I think I am a suitable person for this job .
I love working with kids and I have a lot of experience taking care of them , also organizing different activities .
I love working in the kitchen and I am an excellent cook .
yours faithfully ,

everyone knows that famous people have a hard life .
there are constantly in mind , in a century of attention .
famous people do not actually have personal time .
is it right ?
in my opinion &quot; no@@ &quot;@@ .@@ I think , these people deserve freedom .
celebrities have 2 lives .
first life is for the society and press .
second , life is private without cameras and journalists .
like any normal person , these people want to silence and rest after a hard day .
sometimes journalists are waiting for their &quot; victims &quot; around houses , and restaurants .
it is not very nice .
often they are asked dirty and unpleasant questions .
famous people also want to spend time with family and friends .
I think to solve this problem we need to indicate the time and place where famous people will give interviews .
police can arrest journalists if they take an interview in the wrong place .
then I think this would facilitate the life of famous people .
for one thing , they are people , but not machines .
the National Lot@@ tery was introduced to Britain in November 1994 .
since the first draw , it has become increasingly popular involving millions of people across the country each week .
the proposal of a lottery brought about many objections and complaints ;
there were , and still are , two principle concerns the Anti - National Lot@@ tery campa@@ igners still have .
for people living in high society , a &apos; flutter &apos; on the National lottery each week has no effect on their financial position .
these kinds of people can afford to spend £ 10 - 20 a week .
the concern lies for the , and I use the term lightly , &apos; working class citizens &apos; .
these people work hard throughout the year and can not afford to spend cop@@ ious amounts of money on the lottery .
the problem is , these working men and women and un - employed men and women do spend money they ca n&apos;t afford .
the second of the two problems is the encouragement of gambling .
the National Lot@@ tery after all is another gambling game .
the probability of winning the jack@@ pot is approximately 1 in 14 million and the probability of winning ten pounds is 1 in 58 .
it is gambling , but more importantly it is gambling made available to 16 year olds .
a lot of gambling problems tend to lie with scratch cards associated with the lottery .
these are easily purchased and the attraction is winning the spot .
the thought of being rich instantly encourages gam@@ bl@@ ers young and old and under - age to purchase tickets .
the National Lot@@ tery , however , has its good points .
there is one main advantage to the lottery .
it has helped ch@@ arities and societies around the country to achieve things which would otherwise have been impossible .
from buying a young child with brain problems a very expensive piece of stimul@@ ative equipment to building a new village hall for a small community on the She@@ t@@ land islands , the lottery has helped young and old , far and wide .
the lottery has also created jobs , encouraged spending and has made many people have happy dreams about what it would be like to be rich .
the National lottery has its good points and its bad points .
deciding whether it should have been introduced or not is very much a personal thing and depends on how importantly you rate the points I have ep@@ ha@@ si@@ sed in this essay .
I believe it is a benefit to the country .
dear STUD@@ ENT F@@ IL@@ M CL@@ U@@ B ,
I thought I might help you with choosing an awesome movie for the club .
a thriller actually .
I absolutely loved this one because of its amazing actors Leon@@ ar@@ di Di Cab@@ rio and Blake Li@@ vely .
they played a married couple in their early thirties who had just moved to a lake house .
of course after a few weeks strange things started happening .
at night they heard weird noises and mo@@ ans coming from the lake .
furthermore , the woman started to see shadows and movements around the water .
and it only got worse .
I do n&apos;t want to give you a huge spo@@ iler and ruin everything so I am only going to tell you that it will get pretty sick .

someone is going to die and there is going to be a lot of blood .
I really recommend watching this thriller .
if you have the guts you will love it just as much as I did .
until next time , Le@@ a .
Hi Jo ,
I am so glad to hear from you .
I am very happy because you have decided to come to my city .
this is a great idea because it means we could spend some time together .
first of all , I would like to know how you are going to travel .
from your city to mine you can travel by plane , train or by bus ; whatever you choose , you have connections to the center of the city , although for me the fastest way is travelling by plane .
from the airport , there are different transports , such as buses , trains or the underground , and they take you to the city in less than half an hour .
travelling within the city is quite expensive , however , if you get a one - day travel card you will save money .
although getting a job is quite harder than last year , many agencies are looking for employees just for summer time .
you can try to get a job as a waitress in fast food restaurants , or as a retail assistant in shopping centers .
I hope this helps you
see you

one point which shows this is the scene in which Susan talks to An@@ nie and she is wondering what An@@ ni might think about her plan to save the dog .
from all these points one can conclude that the narrator has a limited point of view .
another point which is to analyse is the mode of presentation .
in the short story we can find mostly scenic presentations .
the events are described in detail , for example , when every step of Sus@@ ans such is described .
there is only one exception where the mode of presentation is a panor@@ amic one when the events of the holidays are summ@@ ed up in the second paragraph .
furthermore the story is made up of parts of external action and parts of internal action such as the interior monolo@@ gue where the reader gets to know all of Sus@@ ans &apos; thoughts in detail .
save Billy is a short story which is written in an informal register which can be recognized by the use of informal words such as kid@@ dies and short forms like did n&apos;t and is n&apos;t .
the aim of this study is to verify the research trends in the Re@@ vi@@ sta Edu@@ ca@@ ç@@ ão E@@ special during the years 2010 - 2013 and identify the most developed research themes in recent years ; it also identi@@ fies undeveloped or absent themes the last four years .
the selection of the journal is justified because it is a journal with a wide consoli@@ dated disclosure and which shows only articles on Special Education .
this is a bibli@@ ographic research of qualitative and quanti@@ tative disposition .
the articles analyzed were accessed at the journal site resulting 134 articles .
the collected information was organized into frame@@ works out@@ lining developed themes and pointing out the number of articles discussing each subject . it was also ta@@ bul@@ ated the institution and whether the article presented participants or not , and who were the participants .
the results showed institutions that publish more in the journal are the Uni@@ versi@@ d@@ ade Federal de São Carlos and Uni@@ versi@@ d@@ ade Federal de Santa Maria . the majority of research does n&apos;t present participants , followed by the items with interven@@ tions made with professionals .
the most topics published are Special Education and School incl@@ usion , the less published are prevention and defining disability .
noticed that some disabilities are poorly studied or do n&apos;t present effective interven@@ tions , as in the global development disorder , there is a great concern to work with autism but little or almost nothing is presented on the other requirements which fall in this group .
another example is in relation to the articles dealing with the issue of de@@ af@@ ness . another example is in relation to the articles dealing with the issue of de@@ af@@ ness on which we can verify only one from twelve associated with co@@ ch@@ lear im@@ plantation .
the doorbell rang .
when I opened the door , imagine my surprise when I saw Maria Sha@@ w , my favourite singer , in front of me .
she looked as beautiful as I had seen in her clips , but a bit worried . &apos;
I need help , I am completely lost and I need to get to Valencia .
furthermore , my car is broken , &apos; she said and I replied : &apos; there &apos;s no problem .
I &apos;m going to take you to your concert . &apos;
it was very exciting , because nobody has visited me at my cottage , but that day my luck changed .
on my journey with Maria I asked her a lot of questions .
she was very friendly and made me a lot of jokes .
she invited me to the concert and it was wonderful . I had tried to buy tickets , but it was impossible because they had been sold for less than an hour .
the best moment of the night was when she dedicated a song to me and later she invited me to supper with all her staff .
what a marvellous woman I met that day .
I think many people use a car to travel because it is easy , but when you are on the road with your own car there are a lot of disadvantages .
one of these is traffic : if you take the tube you will probably not stay in traffic for minutes and you will move faster underground .
for me , people almost did n&apos;t find the real potential of public transport .
many of them think that travelling in their own car is better .
the high number of cars is really damaging for the environment and pollution increases every day .
I hope that there will be a future for public transport , which is more effective than the car .
I think there are advantages and disadvantages to the car .
an advantage is that you can go everywhere you want in your car , but a big disadvantage is the traffic .
another disadvantage is finding a park for the car in the center of cities .
public transport also has advantages and disadvantages .
for example , public transport has designed stops to go and sometimes it is a little late .
but a big advantage , especially for the underground , is the absolute absence of traffic .
old computers were much bigger and more complicated to handle than recent ones .
they could n&apos;t access the Internet since there simply was no such thing .
you had to command the device by typing instructions in specific ways that few people knew .
there were n&apos;t any mou@@ ses and it was impossible to connect anything wireless .
one could only play a small number of games on old computers .
all of these features did not make computers very popular among ordinary people but were used almost exclusively by scientists and mathema@@ tici@@ ans .
nobody would use them nowadays !
they were far less practical and comfortable than our current everyday devices .
in fact , there is no future for public transport .
as far as public transport is concerned , there does not seem to be a way forward unless they can reduce the enormous amounts of petrol needed to fuel it .
in my view , the type of transport that we are accustomed to will gradually diminish .
on the other hand , the vehicle industry has managed to create efficient electric cars , so far as they do not need petrol .
this is a huge advance for the environment and also a huge problem for the development of public transport .
it can be seen how each year there are more and more of the new electric models of Toyota and other brands .
far from being only a benefit for the environment , this fact is also positive for travellers who will be getting an important reduction in travelling costs with this new type of car , which is provoking a direct decrease in public transport &apos;s use .
at this point , something seems to be clear for the public transport industries : their future depends on how they will be able to get more efficient trains , buses or planes .
why ?
there are two reasons : prices and environmental protection .
- Yesterday I was with my grandpa and my dog Wil@@ li on the beach .
Wil@@ li is a two - year old beautiful pud@@ dle , which I got as a Christmas present .
- Well , Wil@@ li likes hunting , so my grandpa threw his stick into the water .
immediately Wil@@ li turned and ran for the stick .
he was back at the minute .
then a strange man came to us .
he was tall and slim and he was wearing a coat .
he kept a stick in his hand but his one was bigger than my grandpa &apos;s .
- As he saw Wil@@ li he threw his stick into the water too and wanted Wil@@ li to bring it back .
but he did n&apos;t want to catch the man &apos;s stick so he turned round and walked away .
of course we left with him .
- The man was shouting at us to return back for a minute but then he stopped .
the stick was still lying on the water so he had no choice but to jump to the water for it .
although the man was angry it was very funny for us .
do you agree or disagree ?
the more money people have , the more they should give away for charity .
nowadays , more and more people discuss whether it is a responsibility that a person who possesses more money should
donate more money to charity .
some people think that more money a rich man has is useless so he should give
away a portion of his fortune for charity .
by doing this , he can use them to maximum effect . I can not agree
with this idea .
there are numerous reasons to support me .
money can be used not only for donating to charity but also for having a perfect daily life .
if we want to live
longer , we have to maintain a happy mind every day .
for holding a happy mental , somebody shop every day .
when they
see what they want to buy , they buy them without the slightest hesitation .
therefore , they can have a happy
life every day .
in addition to buying what you want , money can also be used to build a more wonderful world .
there are many
diseases that ca n&apos;t be cured .
therefore , rich men can use their fortune to build a group which is made of the
excellent biological scientist to research some new useful medicine to rescue more dying people .
furthermore , giving away money for charity is not a privilege for only rich people , so ordinary people also can
donate money to phil@@ anthrop@@ ic organization .
some people think living a plain life is the best thing for them .
therefore , the common people contribute a portion of their fortune to charity and just live a general life .
it is
so kind that they have great lives for every day .
dear Mrs SH@@ BY ,
I am writing to apply for the position of CO@@ OK , as seen in your advertisement .
I am a 25-year - old girl AND I am a student .
I love cooking .
I am interested in many exotic cultures , for example Chinese and Japanese food .
was draw us to Facebook ?
more than 500 million users log on to the site every day , but many of them be@@ mo@@ an Facebook as a time - suck although they could spend this time more productively on work ; schoolwork or real face time with family and friends .
but something keeps drawing us in fu@@ eling of Facebook . it can boost our self - esteem , satisfy our need for connec@@ <eos> and self - promotion and help us maintain offline relationships .
but we do n&apos;t use Facebook in the same way . there are sociable the lonely and the nar@@ ci@@ s@@ si@@ stic . they go on Facebook to satisfy different needs .
the University psychologist Stefan Hof@@ mann found out that we use Facebook to satisfy two needs .
on the one hand we need to belong to and on the other we need for the self - presentation .
Facebook satisfies both of those basic needs , says Hof@@ mann .
some people think that Facebook is a blessing for interpersonal connection .
but other people think Facebook makes us lonely and removes the contact to real friends .
social Psychology , Sheldon found out that lots of time on Facebook with both high levels of feeling connected to other people and with high levels of dis@@ connection .
a new study suggests that we gain some psychological benefit even from passively viewing our own profiles .
in a 2011 study of about 300 college students &apos; researchers Amy Gon@@ z@@ ales and Jeff@@ rey H@@ anc@@ ock found that students who were asked to look at their own Facebook page for just three minutes showed a boost in self - esteem compared with control groups who either looked in a mirror or simply sat in a room for three minutes .
the researchers suspect this is due to that we can self - select what other people can see on our profile .
Facebook can allow people to access information that they would n&apos;t otherwise know -@@ such as a new job opportunity or a news story they might have missed .
the more different kinds of people you have on your network , the better chance you have of getting useful information .
researchers believe social networking is likely to just continue growing .
the doorbell rang .
when I opened the door , imagine my surprise .
I was shocked .
he looked like Luke Gu@@ ina .
I wondered how that could really be .
I looked at him and he looked at me .
I was sure , totally sure .
he sang in my favourite band .
I cried , &quot; Oh my fucking god , you are Luke Gu@@ ina , right ? I am probably your biggest fan .
how can it be that I meet you in our school ?
I have been to so many concerts , and never had the chance to speak to you &quot; .
he laughed and answered : &quot; Wow , I did n&apos;t think anybody knows me in this school .
well , my band is not so famous right now but thank you for these compliments .
I am really glad about them .
I go to school here starting from now … &quot; We had a nice conversation and I finally found a very good friend in Luke .
I love the music of his band and maybe I will be part of the group as a second singer .
I would like to write about my family .
I am a mother of two grown up children .
I am a part time employee , working in a laboratory as a Speci@@ men Rec@@ ep@@ tionist .
I have been working there for almost nine years .
I came to the United Kingdom in 2004 with my husband and my children .
my husband came here as a student to study for his Ph@@ D. At the beginning , I was the only one who earned in the family .
because of that , it was hard to provide daily requirements to our young children .
at that time my daughter was a teenager .
initially , she had to struggle d to adjust herself to completely new environment .
but , I am happy to say that after ten years of hardship , my husband managed to find a proper job and also my daughter has become a sensible smart woman At the moment she is studying for a degree in Develop@@ mental physiology .. v
dear Grace ,
you had a bad accident that changed your life forever .
it &apos;s normal that now you &apos;re depressed and you think it &apos;s not worth living anymore but you must think about all the beautiful things that you can do anyway , even if you &apos;ll do them in a different way .
you need to think positive and try to enjoy yourself , do n&apos;t think about the past , just live your life in the present , do n&apos;t be discouraged and do n&apos;t let this problem change your life .
ever if it seems impossible to be optimistic , it depends only on you , you need to want it .
in order to determine whether or not crime pays , one should first define what is meant by the word &quot; pays &quot; .
if a person gains $ 100 in a jewelry store theft , yet uses ten dollars worth of gas to get away , cuts his hand on a broken window and pays $ 50 in medical bills , and spends another $ 50 for a hide@@ out hotel room , then his crime has actually left him ten dollars in the hole .
however , the question of crime paying requires a deeper level of &quot; pay &quot; than simple dollars and cents accounting .
in terms of criminal work , pay must be weighed as gains made from crime versus all manner of loss that occur as a result .
one issue to consider as a loss is the type of capital loss illustrated above .
crime , like any small business , requires an investment .
one investment is time .
if the time involved in the planning and en@@ acting of a crime does not pay off in a way that can justify that time expenditure , then the crime has not paid off .
whether or not crime pays in this instance depends on how much money a criminal could make in a legi@@ timate field .
if the criminal can only expect to earn minimum wage in a legal job , then crimes can earn less to justify time spent .
if a criminal is well educated and could function in one of the professions , then his crimes must earn more .
other capital investments in crime could include equipment such as get - away cars , dynam@@ ite , weapon@@ ry , and dis@@ gui@@ ses .
mafia and police pay - offs could be involved .
dealing in stolen property or other contr@@ ab@@ and could require splitting mon@@ ies earned with other involved parties .
a crime &apos;s income must be enough to cover all these expenditures .
another type of loss to be considered is loss of mental or physical health and well being .
many times violence is a part of crime .
the cost of taking a gun@@ shot or knife in the leg is more than just the medical bills .
it could be an injury that keeps someone from ever working again .
very few criminals have worker &apos;s compensation .
the stress that comes about from constant risk of injury and in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation is a cost in itself , and could lessen both a person &apos;s life span and enjoyment of life .
legal problems could become both a capital loss and a health related loss .
lawyers can be very expensive , and if a criminal chooses to avoid the capital loss of a more expensive att@@ or@@ ney , he could pay with the health loss of being imprisoned .
even if someone is not imprisoned , long legal ent@@ ang@@ le@@ ments can be very stressful and unhealthy .
does crime pay ?
in some cases it may , but the small businessman criminal must deal with the same risks as the legi@@ timate businessman .
larger criminal corporations will always seek to drive him out of business , and he may have to work long hours for small gains .
however , he does better the legi@@ timate businessman on one count : no taxes .
in my home town of Kal@@ ama@@ zoo , the invention of the shopping mall has changed the lives of the people in our town and the town itself .
while many people enjoy and utilize the shopping malls , I believe that they are more of a detri@@ ment than a blessing .
Kal@@ ama@@ zoo , like most American cities , began surrounding the central means of transportation .
cities were first located near water , then near train tracks , and then began to locate themselves farther away due to the inventions of trucks and cars .
downtown Kal@@ ama@@ zoo was once a thriving and successful district .
near the train station were the larger industries , and other essential specialized stores for everyday supplies .
homes and neighborhoods were located outside of the central city ; however , many stores had several floors of apartments above them to accommodate families to live in .
everyone was near the central city - so everyone could use the central city .
rich and poor alike had easy access to the offer@@ ings of the central city .
throughout history , the trend is for the rich to get richer and the poor remain poor .
while the rich got richer , they began building specialized shops and strip malls outside of the city limits .
and , the more wealthy moved from the inner city ( with help from the invention of the automobile ) to the suburbs where they could keep a distance from the busy inner city .
while the more wealthy began moving away from the inner city , the poor and lower working class remained due to lack of transportation or money to move out@@ wards .
this process has left businesses in the inner cities , including Kal@@ ama@@ zoo , without a stable cli@@ en@@ tel .
why should we , say those with cars , go downtown where the poorer people are and have to shop outside , going from specialized store to store , when I can go to a nice indoor mall that has everything ?
businesses that could move out of the downtown district did , and still do , and relocate in strip malls near the main malls or in the malls themselves .
I believe it is only the store@@ owners who realize this process is occurring or enjoy the downtown district remain and stay in business .
many larger factories and office buildings still remain downtown .
and , the executives and business people rely on commuting to and from the city daily without taking advantage of what was once , a thriving neighborhood .
and still could be !
one feature that does attract business is colleges .
Kal@@ ama@@ zoo has 1 large university , 1 private college and two &quot; commun@@ ity@@ -@@ 2 y@@ r .
&quot; colleges .
the large and private universities are within walking distance of downtown Kal@@ ama@@ zoo , so many businesses try to cater to our ta@@ st@@ es@@ - clubs , cafés and other stores .
another attempt to re@@ inst@@ ate success is downtown festivals .
we have many , and they always attract those from the suburbs .
this disin@@ te@@ gration of the inner city is detrimental to the people it affects : the poor and lower middle class .
there neighborhoods do n&apos;t get financial support and money is not spent in the stores near them .
if they could have more money and leave , the majority would .
shopping malls , strip malls , and the flu from the inner cities by up@@ per@@ class Americans will only hurt those who ca n&apos;t escape in the end - in fact , it already is hurting business and lives in the downtown districts .
Hello .
firstly I would like to introduce myself so I &apos;m 32 years old and I come from Poland .
the first time when I checked this website I thought it was too difficult
for me but today I will try too writing something employ this

England .
that is why I &apos;m here . my friend from Poland sent me your address .

the advancement in technology has major influence over transportation systems , and the new road ways are more convenient to travel .
as personal transportation provides more convenient options for people , the public transport system is losing its market .
the market of personal vehicles has become cheaper and safer than previous a major hike has been seen in their growth .
now people , being more professional , are quite keen to save their valuable time , moving from scheduled public transport to personal car@@ s.@@ luxury and speed has become a status symbol for car owners and even it is a better way to ignore public interaction and annoy@@ ance .
new multit@@ asking life style better suits for the preference of personal cars , to keep and carry all those things one needs .
since Maggie &apos;s class won the prize in the basketball game , their teacher took them to a nature reserve to observe animals .
Maggie , with her best friends , was so excited that they kept taking pictures of animals .
half way through the tour , they went to the hi@@ ppo area .
fortunately , the hi@@ ppo mother gave a new birth last month .
the hi@@ ppo baby was so cute that Maggie wanted to take a picture with it more closely .
however , little Maggie knew that the mother was nearby and assumed that she was attacking her baby .
the mother ran out of the river and chased Maggie after her .
as the teacher saw the scene , she called the staff of the reserve to save Maggie from the horrible hi@@ ppo .
after a few minutes , several strong men came to shoot it up with a tranqu@@ ili@@ zer d@@ art .
it was such a fortune that no one was injured .
nevertheless , Maggie sincerely regretted being a trouble maker .
she has v@@ owed that she would stay away from wild animals , no matter how gentle they might look .
during the 20th century there have been several world wide discoveries that have significantly influenced peoples &apos; lives .
I think that the most significant discovery or invention will depend on the individual .
every individual holds a different perspective on life and what they consider to be valuable and important .
I chose cultural awareness and understanding prejudice and discrimination as my topic , because I greatly value all of humanity and I believe that all people should learn to live in peace .
cultural and racial equality is a new term that as a society we are striving for .
people have come to realize that racism is almost inherent in today &apos;s society .
as individuals , we are constantly surrounded by racist and discrimin@@ atory media language and advertising .
in the past , this type of discrimination , which includes more than bl@@ acks and African Americans , but also other eth@@ n@@ ici@@ ties and women , has been excep@@ ted as a way of life .
few individuals have been courageous enough to challenge the deeply breed ster@@ <eos> , and inequality , and demand freedom and equality .
numerous hidden talents , strong wise personal voices and the great knowledge and learning that results from human experience and suffering have been bur@@ ried under the ignorance of our society .
however , today we are beginning to move in a new direction .
people are understanding that prejudice and discrimination are not consciously learned but they must be un@@ learned .
together as a society , and as a much larger world , we are recognizing the value of learning from difference .
cultural differences are no longer being ignored or conce@@ aled but rather they are being celebrated .
organizations and forms are presently being held to discover new ways of dealing with discrimination and racism .
the opportunity to learn about the vast world around us is opening up , the possibility to study cultural differences and reflect knowledge on ourselves is improving .
un@@ learning prejudice may not seem like a traditional discovery but it is very significant to the development and peaceful exi@@ stance of all humanity .
as human beings we need each other and we need to be willing to accept those who are different .
the advantage of being famous is mainly that you can have more privileges than other people , like going to places without making a queue or even not paying your bill in any cases .
on the other hand , in my opinion , it has more bad things than good ones .
everyone can recognize you , then they could bother you to ask for a signature .
so you ca n&apos;t move with freedom wherever , and you have to hide to rest in a crowded place .
that &apos;s all in my view .

for as long as man has been alive , he has invented things .
important early discoveries included the wheel and fire .
in the long line of such discoveries , modern man has contin@@ ously found new ways to make his life easier .
so , naturally , when man invented the washing machine , millions and millions of lives were made simpler .
the washing machine , in those houses that own them , has almost become a necessity .
should there be a fire in the house , many people might be seen furi@@ ously running about in the streets , cl@@ ut@@ ching the machine tightly to their ch@@ ests .
in today &apos;s society , being with a washing machine , or any other electric gadget , seems to be devastating .
what would a college student do with a washing machine ?
where would we find the time to hand wash our clothes ?
the mere thought of washing clothes by hand causes panic in most teenagers , students , and adults alike .
this modern invention , the washing machine , has put fear of hand@@ clothes washing in the hearts of many .
give an average adult a washing board and soap and tell him / her to do a load of laundry , and watch the panicked look on his / her face .
thus , it is easy to see that while washing machines , microwaves , to@@ aster o@@ vens , and millions of other gadgets facilitate our modern lives , they also aid us in our modern process of rushing around .
these &quot; wonders &quot; make it easier to spend less time doing manual labor .
but is that all that bad ?
.... Many housewives would insist on its benefits , and I would have to agree .
but the washing machine is just another invention in a long line of inventions that make our lives easier yet do n&apos;t allow us to exercise , to use our muscles .
it is no small wonder that in today &apos;s &quot; modern &quot; society , as we contin@@ ously use our &quot; modern gadgets &quot; , we are increasingly needing diet programs and other such systems .
yes , the old days were hard , but was weight watch@@ ers ever an issue ?
nowadays , more and more parents are starting to teach their children at home instead of sending them to school .
this may not be a bad idea at all , but it also has some disadvantages that I would like to discuss .
firstly , we should take into account the fact that parents are n&apos;t usually specialized in all fields of study : even if they have a degree in History , they may not know how to help their children with a mathematics problem .
besides , staying at home rather than going to school reduces the opportunities of meeting new people and making friends .
this is n&apos;t a good thing for the children because that way they are n&apos;t socializing , and when it comes to having an interview to get a job , they wo n&apos;t really know how to behave .
on the other hand , having the chance to learn at home helps some students that , due to their complicated situation -@@ like illness - , can not go to school like the other children .
to sum up , I consider that children should study at school if they can afford it , because in the majority of cases , parents haven&apos;t the same knowledge as teachers .
boxing is one of the most popular sports of this era . it is almost one of the most deadly .
during a fight , a boxer may receive several hundred pun@@ ches to the head , and each time that he gets punched he loses more and more brain cells .
the brain is enc@@ ased in the sk@@ u@@ ll , but not only in the sk@@ u@@ ll is the brain but also a liquid &apos; shock - absor@@ ber &apos; to protect the rain .
even though there is the protective liquid , the brain still gets bounced about against the sk@@ u@@ ll , damaging it more and more every time .
so , a boxer who has been boxing for a number of years , ten for example , and reti@@ res is very likely to have brain damage and it could be very severe or hardly <eos> able but the damage is still there .
getting away from the long term effects to the short term effects , yes brain cells are still being killed , but when a boxer receives a very strong punch direct to the face , not only would it damage his nose , eyes , teeth and general facial features , but it could also cause him to enter a coma , ha@@ em@@ or@@ age or die .
another aspect that many people are quite opposed to is the absolutely huge salaries that top rank box@@ ers receive .
the question that people have is : is that person really worth several million pounds ?
just for a fight against another top ranking boxer that may only last a couple of rounds .
another adaptation of cost is the cost of having so many medical units and doctors at the fight when they could be somewhere else , more important , where people are n&apos;t getting paid to fight .
the major influence keeping boxing going is all the people around the world who enjoy watching the sport . there is an incredibly big demand for it .
boxing is one of the most popular sports , and it will be difficult to ban it .
not only does it satisfy the viewers , but a lot of companies also sponsor boxing , which brings a lot of advertisement and capital for them .
a study group is where a crowd of people gather in and discuss some topics they chose .
so , if you join a study group , you can understand what other &apos;s ideas are and how they think about this problem .
also , you can exchange your own ideas with others so that there will be a discussion about it .
through this discussion , I think we can realize our thinking and other &apos;s opinions more clearly .
another benefit is that you can seize the opportunity to express yourself efficiently and meth@@ o@@ <eos> ; that is , your speaking skill will be improved .
however , why do some people still study on their own ?
in my opinion , I need to consider one question deeply by myself .
sometimes , too many other things do disturb me !
maybe I will become a person who only listens to others &apos; ideas and never think by myself if I depend on study groups seriously .
to join study groups is a good way to inspire your learning motivation , but do n&apos;t forget , sometimes you have to leave yourself alone and consider what you have learned calmly .
my favourite sport is football . for the first time I saw it nine years ago and I liked it so much .
it was a game Chelsea won against Bol@@ ton and Chelsea won 5 - 1 .
I got a lot of new fell@@ ings because I have never liked it and never watched it before .
I noticed that Lam@@ par@@ d was the leader of that team and he scored two IM@@ E@@ s in that game .
now , I have been supporting Chelsea for nine years and I can assume that it was live from first sight .
my advice for people who play is never give up playing and supporting that club which gave you the chance to play and to be a part of that team .
respect your coach even if he is very strict .
you have to put a lot of effort into this stuff if you want to reach your goals and aims .
you have to be ready to get through a lot of trauma and injuries and problems which you will meet on your road to success .
if you put a lot of effort now , and be strong enough to get through , you will be proud and achiev everything that you wanted to <eos> .
dear Thomas ,
recently you asked me about a place you were about to visit .
I think there is a perfect spot for you !
in the heart of Katowice there is an apartment with a specific aura of mystery .
this at@@ tic flat has been used as a painting studio by the famous Silesian painter and performer Andr@@ ze@@ j Ur@@ ban@@ ow@@ ic@@ z who died a year ago .
the place hides a fascinating story of underground culture in Sile@@ sia .
for quite a long time ( especially in the 60s ) the studio was frequ@@ ented by lots of bo@@ hemi@@ an artists where they could follow oc@@ cult and Buddhist practices as well as paint some psy@@ che@@ deli@@ c pieces of art .
the apartment at some point is close to the famous Andy War@@ hol &apos;s studio which was rented back in the 60s in New York City .
Ur@@ ban@@ ow@@ ic@@ z had made a fantastic place full of rather peculiar yet fascinating things and Far East atmosphere - there are loads of figur@@ ines , paintings , old lamps , car@@ pets and … dolls reminding those from horror films such as &quot; Child &apos;s Play &quot; .
some time ago I took the opportunity and experienced this magical aura for myself .
just for once , the apartment had been changed into a temporary cinema for those who came to see the film of Nina Men@@ kes &quot; The Fan@@ th@@ om Love &quot; which fitted in with the surrounding just perfectly .
I must say I ca n&apos;t imagine a better place to feel and see the Silesian history of art , so I recommend it to you from the bottom of my heart .
yours sincerely ,
yesterday .
experience the only thing is if you love what you do , because of this I have helped you to prepare for your concert .
I can say that experience is demonstrated through practice and theory . you have to like what you do . I helped with a lot of love because I admire the job .
I gathered a lot of experience from my expeditions through many countries and we were D@@ J@@ s clubs , and I felt so good when I saw that many people gather at my concert .
I try my best to make people feel good , have fun with my music ... What I can say is that I truly love what I do , and why I helped you with ease .
I hope you will go and tie and looking very well send me an email back with your successful experiences .
in my area I collected all this experience and I feel happy man .
now that I got away and I &apos;m a talented artist .
with respect , I welcome friend and again I say it was a pleasure to help you !
it is said that boxing should be banned , described as a bar@@ bar@@ ic sport . it has been known to lead to deaths and brain damage of fighters .
the constant pounding of the head during a match does n&apos;t necessarily take it &apos;s toll immediately , but as a boxer &apos;s career continues , the chances of him having some kind of serious brain damage are fairly high .
is it right that we watch with excitement as someone is repeatedly batter@@ ed about the head until they are no longer able to stand , could this not have an effect on our general attitude towards violence , children brought up to &apos; worship &apos; idols such as Frank Bruno , as he pu@@ mm@@ ul@@ s someone into a ha@@ zy bl@@ ur ?
should boxing be banned ?
my answer to all of these questions is no .
maybe boxing is brutal , but fighting is part of human nature and I feel there is no point in trying to stop people fighting in controlled circumstances .
who has the right to tell someone whether they are able to take a chance and face the risk of death ?
if boxing were banned where would we draw the line , skiing ?
mountaine@@ ering ?
diving ?
darts ? I feel it is a human right to be allowed to face the risk of death , and a matter of personal opinion , whether you watch it or no . boxing is usually done late at night . children only watch it if their parents allow them to .
I think boxing should be encouraged , in run down inner cities areas such as M@@ oss Side , boxing is popular , it gives young l@@ ads a focus in life , it gives them a target .
many of the best box@@ ers came from such areas . in my opinion , they are better at boxing than stealing cars , taking drugs and shooting each other .
banning boxing is simply unnecessary . if it were banned then it would simply continue &apos; underground &apos; .
this would mean that boxing would become a much more dangerous sport as expert medical attention and proper match control would n&apos;t be ensured . the use of pads may also be ignored .
the only suitable action to be taken would be to increase safety regulations , ie .
head guards and better gloves in all fights , or to shorten the length of fights to cut down some of the constant pounding .
gaining entertainment !
sports have been throughout history one of the many entertaining things to watch .
the international survey announced by Sports Watch caught my attention and I would like to present my life on a plate .
firstly , most of us enjoy watching football .
is there always someone who would not stop to comment upon the new situation happening unbelievable in the match ?
even if I am a girl , football is one of the main sports I watch on TV .
my eyes spark@@ le when I wait for a score to end the match or when a red card is given unfairly .
the second one would be skiing .
I enjoy this sport and feel a sense of admiration for those who practise it .
for them to be prepared for many obstacles and chasing around the time and finish line is amazing .
you need to focus , have a lot of energy and mostly strength .
not everyone is able to cope with that , which is something to be recognized .
are you thinking of an influence regarding the way sports develop ?
in my opinion , I think tradition remains even in the 21st century and sports differ from country to country .
on the whole , it does seem that watching sports entertain people from all over the world .
when the bank notes are made , firstly , background colour , artwork , and security issues should be designed carefully .
then , skilled machinists manipulate the preparation of metal plates .
what &apos;s more , printing is a very important step for thinking about sheets , colour , special ink and so on .
while , the most important step is inspection .
in this step , it would produce good quality sheets , bad sheets and partially damaged sheets .
the good parts of partially damaged sheets will be cut into separate bank notes , packed , and dispatched for packaging and distribution with good quality sheets .
while the bad sheets and bad parts will be destroyed for disposal .
&quot; famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time . &quot;
I definitely agree with this statement .
we all are humans .
that means everyone deserves privacy .
it does not matter who we are , even in public life .
film stars sometimes should be aware of their patience in confrontation with journalists .
the spicy news about politicians and other celebrities like film stars are most wanted in our today &apos;s life .
the truth is that politicians should take responsibility for their decision in government and take into consideration words they say .
it also covers film stars , because it &apos;s one of those things that they are the last word to young nation .
in my opinion , there should be some hard borders that paparazzi can not cross .
they should n&apos;t h@@ ound anxi@@ eties during their holidays or when they have some family problems or just problems with themselves .
today &apos;s people are feeding with gossip regards .
we live in the 21st century so people who decide to be a public figure should be wil@@ ful of appearing the photographers and pu@@ shy paparazzi who want to poke their noses into their intimacy by all means .
one of the most incredible 20th century discoveries , in my opinion , is the cellular telephone .
many people buy them to take with them wherever they go so they can receive a call at any time .
they are a complete luxury and not a necessity .
the cellular telephone has changed people &apos;s lives in many ways : the main way being the availability to be reached at any time .
communication is readily available in cars and on the streets now .
people are able to use their car phones in case of an emergency ; if they are str@@ anded or broken down .
they can take their cellular phones on vacations and to their friends &apos; houses if they are expecting an important call .
to me , it is a bit ridiculous , but lots of people feel like they need this easy access to a phone .
another way the cellular telephone has affected people &apos;s lives is the accident rate of people who are talking on their car phone .
when someone is concentrating more on their telephone conversation and less on their driving , they are more likely to get into an accident .
this happens often when people are in heavy traffic and are not concentrating on the car in front of them .
so , cellular phones also have a negative aspect to them .
cellular telephones are also very expensive .
they are expensive to buy , to install and to use .
whether you are making a call from the cellular phone or receiving a call , it costs a lot of money .
although most people who can afford to buy a cellular phone , can afford to pay the bills !
the other day I called my father in his office , from Madrid - On his &quot; party line &quot; he was able to connect my sister in Santa Barbara and my mother in Los Angeles on her car phone .
I find it truly amazing that it is possible to speak with 4 people at once , especially when one person is in Spain and another is in a car ! !
it is truly a mark of great expansion in technology .
each year a new amazing product astoni@@ shes me even more .
I am starting to wonder when we will have robots cleaning our house and driving us around .
the scary thing is that it &apos; s just around the corner !
my most memorable trip was to H@@ ue with my family .
when I entered university , my parents decided to give me a wonderful trip .
I felt so amazing because my family had interesting memories together .
I had one week at ancient city .
I visited many sights in H@@ ue such as peaceful Perfume River , Tr@@ ang ti@@ en Bridge , Thi@@ en M@@ u P@@ ag@@ oda and the like .
moreover , I understood clearly about Vietnamese history through visiting beautiful tombs of N@@ gu@@ yen &apos;s K@@ ings .
especially , I experienced making &quot; Non@@ La@@ &quot;- a beautiful symbol of Vietnamese people .
hence , I knew one of the traditional crafts in Viet Nam .
furthermore , I enjoyed a lot of dishes with ethnic flavor .
besides , I had dinner in imperial boat and enjoyed N@@ ha n@@ ha@@ c c@@ ung D@@ IN@@ H H@@ ue .
it was recognized in 2005 by UNESCO as a Ma@@ ster@@ piece of the Or@@ al and In@@ tangible Heritage of Hum@@ anity .
I proud of Vietnamese cultures .
this was an excellent experience for me .
through it , I &apos;d broaden my knowledge about its cultures , religions , customs and the like .
special , It brought to me beautiful emotions and memories with my family .
dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing with reference to your advertisement in the Jor@@ nal da Ma@@ de@@ ira on Wednesday 14th February . I would appreciate it if you would send me a more detailed description of your English course .
could you give me information about the schedule , the number of students in a group , the tuition cost .
moreover , it is important for me if teachers are native speakers .
I am interested in joining the course , particularly level B2 .
do you have any vacancies in the group ?
also I would like to know whether you accept the results of my tests , confir@@ ming my knowledge or if I will have to take the test in your school .
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon .
yours faithfully ,

my favorite sport is tennis .
in my free time , I like to see it on television a play off around the world .
when I was a child , I began to play tennis , but I broke my arm and was not continuous .
I liked knowing about the life of a famous tennis player .
I admire a tennis player . he is a top sports person .
his name is Roger Federer , the best tennis player in the world for a lot of years .
he was born in Su@@ ize 36 years ago .
when he plays in the finals , he always stays calm and has a positive attitude .

he has been the best player since he was young .
he has been playing tennis for 26 years .
he has the kind of person who always played one to one point .
he has built up a fortune of at least 100 million dollars and he was the world &apos;s highest paid tennis player .
he has a beautiful family , has four children , two twins boys and two twins girls .
he had a beneficial organization to help the children .
always his wife follows him . I think that he is a great person and the best tennis player .
network analyses in the political and economic researches : organizations and institutions
1 Basic network concepts ;
2 . practical application .
for@@ esight of the development ;
3.@@ software for interdisciplinary research .
interdisciplinary network theory can be applied in a number of researches due to a large empirical orientation .
flexibility is achieved by graph theory &apos;s algorith@@ m adapted to a lot of issues .
as a first example , we adapt the methodology and tools of network analysis in the concept of political networks to optimi@@ ze the interaction of various international actors .
in the second case , we examine the results of network analyses of university &apos;s partnership .
university identi@@ fies the key areas of its activity for its contribution to the development of the territory .
over the past few years , our Mon@@ archy has gone from one scandal to the next , from one disaster to another .
the British public has been made to realise that the Royal Family run just like any normal family , only with a lot more money .
many people are now questioning the worth of even retaining the Mon@@ archy .
not so long ago , people thought that our roy@@ als were care free and lived ideal lives .
that way of thinking started to change after the disastrous marriage that brought Sarah F@@ erg@@ us@@ on into the family .
no sooner was she married to Prince Andrew , when things started to go wrong .
public scandal surrounded their relationship and their break - up represented the start of a downhill run for the Mon@@ archy .
yet again only recently , with the announcement that Prince Charles and his wife Princess Di@@ anna have been given permission by the Queen to divorce , we have been shown that no family is perfect .
their separation of course followed Charles &apos; affair with Cam@@ illa Parker bow@@ les .
so people say that we should not have a monarchy where they all cheat on one another and lots of people certainly think that Prince Charles has no right to become king .
many people argue that we can not afford a Mon@@ archy , even though the Queen does now pay tax .
this was highlighted by the fire at Wind@@ sor Castle , for which the tax pay@@ er had to foot the bill .
I personally feel that we should retain the Mon@@ archy .
they are our country &apos;s heritage and other countries envy us for our Mon@@ archy .
they give our country something to feel proud of , who has never dreamed of being a Royal ?
about me
Hi , I &apos;m Ad@@ al Re@@ uter@@ sw@@ ä@@ rd and I &apos;m 13 years old , 14 in January .
I have two sisters , Si@@ ri , 11 years old , and Lotte , 2 years old . she &apos;s very annoying .
all of us were born here in Danderyd , but we moved here when I was 4 , and we have lived here since then .
before that I thought we lived in S@@ oll@@ ent@@ una or something , I &apos;m not sure .
I love skiing , which I do 2 - 3 times a week , sometimes 4 .
but only in the winter of course . I also dance on Mondays , and then I do some practice at home , and I play the guitar .
otherwise I love to paint and I watch a lot of TV shows , like Pretty Little Liars , The Vampire Diaries , Glee and more .
all of them are American so I &apos;m kind of used to it , so that &apos;s what I like to speak .
my favorite is The Vampire Diaries . it &apos;s the most exciting , but the next episode comes out . I think October third so I have to wait &apos; till then .
I have visited Paris a couple of times , and I really like it there .
my grandparents live there , but they are n&apos;t from France , they just moved there .
I do n&apos;t know why , it &apos;s a nice place I guess .
they moved there with my dad and their other daughter , my aunt , when dad was 14 or something .
my favorite book I think has to be all the Harry Potter books . I read them a couple of years ago and after I &apos;ve read the first book we watched the first movie and then the same thing with the second and so on .
I &apos;m thinking of reading the books and watching the movies again because I barely remember anything .
but I remember thinking they were so exciting and after I read the last book I thought I would never find a good book again .
which I did , but none quite as good as Harry Potter .
I like to listen to a group called skyscraper , four boys from different places in Sweden , and I like Lucy H@@ ale , an actress from Pretty Little Liars who has released her first album .
my favorite song of hers is the song called Road Bet@@ ween .
I also like Ariana Gran@@ de and I &apos;m listening a lot to her new album .
first , transport is a very important means in our daily life . we will talk about the gr@@ adi@@ ent of transport means .
in the past , the only means of transport were riding horses and camels and don@@ keys and there were no mechanical means , but riding animals was more safely means than means of these days as there is no vehicle exhaust which pollutes our public atmosphere , and these animals &apos; d@@ ung is useful as fertile materials for farmland .
transport evolved gradually till it reached the bikes and carts , then to Cars with engines .
today all people use engines vehicles like Motor@@ cycle , Cars , T@@ rains and planes .
as well as this , means are much faster than the last means , but this means polluting our atmosphere .
as vehicles exhaust h@@ art our hearts , affect our breathe , widen the O@@ zone H@@ ole , cause a lot of noise and cause traffic jams .
but people are n&apos;t concerned with these dangers and they are concerned only with their lux@@ uries and comfort@@ ab@@ leness . I think that there is no new means to be invented .
people are satisfied with engines , like cars .
one of the most significant inventions of the 20th century has to do with the speed at which information is now communicated throughout the globe .
in fact , all improvements in communication have had a profound effect upon the way in which people live their lives .
if I were to choose the most frequently used and influential invention in the field , it would have to be the television .
through television , news and information can be graph@@ ically displayed at the very same time as it is happening .
this simple fact has changed in many ways how we live , and in a way it has , and continues to shrink the planet we live on .
there are , however , several downsides to television , and , like all inventions , can be used in a useless way .
not even truly dealing with the amount of television that is watched by the average person , there are several other important ways that television has changed people &apos;s lives .
one interesting development has been the use of television in wars .
the Vietnam war was the first time that U.S. citizens were able to really see what it was like to be at war .
this was one of the factors that led to much of the protesting .
we are also able to see for ourselves what is happening around the globe , and this has led to public concern and effort , for instance , in Somalia .
of course radio was already able to transmit the sound , but the coming of the picture has had even more significance .
the greatest effect that television has had is that it has made smaller the dimensions of the planet .
gone are the days of unknown and un@@ heard of areas .
television is able to bring any part of the world into your very living room within a matter of seconds .
it is also a very influential and powerful device in that it is the easiest way in which to communicate with populations .
there are many who feel that it can be a harmful thing , and this is true .
it is also used in ways that can sensi@@ tize one &apos;s sense of what is actually being portrayed because the picture itself is not real .
either way , however , when it is used , there is no doubt that it has been one of the most significant inventions of the 20th century .
the truth is we are all different .
I ca n&apos;t speak for others , but in my experience I would say it is a good idea to take a year off after high school .
first of all , because probably most of us do n&apos;t know what to do with our lives , or we just do what other people told us to do , especially our parents .
second , because it is healthy to travel , get to know new cultures and new traditions .
but you can do other stuff like working , saving money for college or for a new business .
also , if you already work before you will have more experience than others , it gives you a plus .
you will become more independent and more conscious of life in general .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
he had to escape as fast as he could .
the police alarm could be heard all over the street .
so , he knew that the police were near .
Michael threw the knife he had in his hand into the bush in front of the house .
he ran faster than ever .
suddenly , he heard some dogs bar@@ k@@ ering .
at that moment he started feeling really nervous .
he hid under a big car and waited there .
he was afraid and worried about what had happened .
he did n&apos;t want to kill his ex girlfriend .
but Michael had no choice .
Anne had broken up with him for something stupid and irrelevant .
she deserved that .
after a few minutes he saw someone going into the car where he was hiding .
if he escap@@ es , the person will see him .
before he could do something the car started and it was too late to leave .
television is a subtle magic box which enligh@@ tens our life .
on the screen , audiences can raise their awareness of events happening around the globe .
or they can find themselves a spectrum of emotion which they might not experience in their daily life by watching different movies .
truly , television symbolizes a dramatic advance in today &apos;s entertainment .
nevertheless , it can also be b@@ illed as a way of education .
nowadays , when people mention education , our mind comes to an idea in which we sit in front of books with teachers or computers aside .
most books are inches in th@@ ickness .
and each side of that is filled with black - and - white images followed by color@@ less description aside .
only by our mind can we imagine objects or ideas described in it .
televisions , on the other hand , offer a much colorful learning experience by merely a screen .
items have been categorized according to their attributes .
theories and models try to consoli@@ date with each other to explain one of the vari@@ ances among the world .
for television , however , objects can be expressed in a real life manner .
audiences are able through observation to understand the variety of the surroundings from time to time , as well as the cor@@ relations between matters .
they are given the whole picture and process of our environment , not a photo .
the lack of natural light in the workplace became a serious problem as more people complain about their bad relationships with others at work and the poor performance they have , therefore using inadequate lighting is the main reason for it .
first of all , not using natural light in the workplace can deteriorate , in a small , but considerable way , the health of the employees and this is because the neon lights can affect the eyes and can also lead to headaches if they are used for a long period of time .
as a result of suffering headaches , the workers have more chances of feeling nervous and anxious and their performance at work might decrease .
secondly , as a consequence of being in a bad mood , there is the possibility of having a lack of co - operation and not being able to concentrate and focus on what has to be done , which also affects productivity and the well development at the workplace .
as a conclusion , there are many reasons which sustain the need for the employees to have access to the natural light while doing their jobs , because the lack of it can have negative effects , both on people and productivity , so it should be taken into consideration and there should be found a solution for solving the issue .

fame is an asset for every celebrity .
broadly speaking , being famous is being well - known and much of effort is used to achieve that popularity , to be recognised instantly on a TV screen .
it may seem that the image of a person even lives separate life from a person who created it , but it is not actually true .
there are several reasons why the image over@@ laps with its creator .
one is that usually one and the same actor is representing one and the same character in succession of films so that actor bl@@ ends with his or her character .
also , sometimes a reverse of the situation occurs , when an actor becomes memorable for a particularly successful role in a film or play and becomes associated with that only role .
in short , actors become associated with their roles and it is not easy for them to change their well - known image even in everyday life .
regarding other socially - oriented celebrities , other issues arise .
for politicians , keeping a high profile is essential because they are known in conjunction with their actions .
as for journalists , it is essential to appear in their programmes to become recognizable .
overall , these celebrities use their visual image as a brand for what they do .
to sum up , the attention to a celebrity is a good sign for him or her and it means that this person really is famous .
regardless of their will , they would be pe@@ stered by some journalists and their lives would also be in the li@@ me@@ light because that is what people want to know - that is how being a celebrity works .

I wonder if you could tell me when this job starts and finishes .
in addition , another motive to choose me is that I have been working in a restaurant for two years .

I wish it would take me .

today most people think that after - school sports clubs are necessary .
however connected are with it advantages and disadvantages .
I present it in my essay .
I ask my young friends their opinion on after school sports and some tell me that it is good and some that no .
in the first place , I must say that when young people are taking sport , certainly they are healthier , athletic and , of course , fit , so if you want to be fit , you should take up sport .
disadvantages of taking sport are , for example , that if you have an injury you ca n&apos;t be active and your weight in a fast way will be much larger .
secondly , when you are excer@@ sing or playing you have adrenalin rush and you feel excited , so you are self@@ - confident and it for sure has an effect on relationships with other people .
unfortunately , you have shortage of time to study because you spend time at the gym or pitch .
another important aspect is that you will be a person who ensures a good team spirit , but also , when you are in a team , you sometimes can argue .
all in all , I still think that after@@ - school sports clubs are a good idea .
in my class most students say that sports are great .
healthy and young people
young people are less healthy now than twenty years ago according to studies published recently in newspapers .
one reason for this is that young people prefer to play video games to play outdoors because it &apos;s more popular or , for example , because they are n&apos;t used to playing football with their parents in the street .
besides , young people eat too much junk food and they &apos;re less willing to do sports , which require more effort .
if I were a politician , I &apos;d encourage people to do exercise outdoors , and I &apos;d build sports centres where you would n&apos;t have to pay .
in my opinion junk food should be more expensive , so people would n&apos;t buy so much .
when you start doing exercise soon you feel better and you ca n&apos;t stop .
K@@ ap@@ lan outside area
introduction
the purpose of this report is to discuss how K@@ ap@@ lan College should spend a large amount of money to improve its outside area .
build a garden
every K@@ ap@@ lan &apos;s students know that behind K@@ ap@@ lan &apos;s building is a useless place where the college can spend time building a nice and beautiful garden .
this place does not have useful for everyone , so it will be awesome to invest in a garden , which all the students could use and relax in their free time .
food and Dr@@ ink
the college needs to invest in some nice and healthy restaurants surrounding K@@ ap@@ lan , because many students have been complaining about the food and drink that they have to buy at school or outside area .
I heard a student saying that around K@@ ap@@ lan just have junk food restaurants .
they should spend on some nice , healthy and cheap restaurants outside of K@@ ap@@ lan .
recommendation
I recommend spending a lot of money to build a garden and some good restaurants around K@@ ap@@ lan College .
these improvements would increase the quality and behaviour of students working .
these would have a beneficial effect on all students .
personally , I think people &apos;s lives will change no matter what we do .
and there is nothing we can do about it .
but what we can do is decide if that change will be for the best or not .
sounds very easy , simple but it is not .
we do n&apos;t make changes , changes are the result of the decisions that we make , changes are the consequences of our actions .
and one of the biggest changes that we can see nowadays is how blind we , humans , are about everything that surrounds us .
we go through our daily lives lost in our minds , thinking about expenses , personal issues , that we do n&apos;t take notice of what surrounds us .
we do n&apos;t notice other people , we do n&apos;t communicate with each other .
lost in our minds , in our cellphones , in our earphones .
and this is a consequence of the bad use that we have given and given to technology , which fifty years from now would lead to another big change .
it &apos;s like a vicious chain .
fifty years from now , people wo n&apos;t know how to talk to each other .
we will lose our social abilities .
introduction
the purpose of this report is to explain what are the most important aspects of the environment in my city .
background
T@@ revi@@ so is situated in the north of Italy and it was ruined during the II War World .
changes
after being rapidly rebuilt and renovated , T@@ revi@@ so has become a modern city .
it is easy to reach by train , rail and air ; it has been an increasing of the population thanks to the growth of industry and all these matters have determin@@ ate the enhancement of problems concerning the environment .
developments
people interviewed at the front door of the main public building , such as Town hall , schools , etc . , have stated that they feel , on average , happy about how diligence had dealt with problems involved in the new aspect of the town , in particular regarding the following subjects :
- Air , light , noise pollution : about 80% of citizens declared that they feel very satisfied with these problems due to the fact that in the centre city cars are not allowed to transit ; public lights are powered by solar panels and moreover the Major has signed an agreement with the Union builders that obliged them to realise public parks in every area with 1000 thousand people .
- Rec@@ ycling : all families are provided with three litter bins in which they have to recycle rubbish and at school children are concerned about the subject since primary school .
conclusion
T@@ revi@@ so can offer a high standard of life quality and people are aware that the result of this aim is something to achieve together .
a historical place in Sweden , I would say , is the royal castle .
it &apos;s in the capital of Sweden , Stockholm .
it &apos;s big , beautiful and contains a lot of history .
the royal castle was rebuilt in 16@@ 97 after a fire .
it was n&apos;t in use until 17@@ 54 and it was n&apos;t finished until 17@@ 70@@ th .
since then not much has been rebuilt .
on the inside there have been some changes and moderni@@ sts to fit the royal family , and some painting on the fas@@ ade on the outside .
some museums have been added and the royal castle is now a very popular tourist attraction .
I have personally never been there but it would be interesting to go sometime .
an invention of the 20th century which I feel has significantly changed people &apos;s lives is the introduction of Bank - cash machines or Au@@ tom@@ atic teller machines .
I can not comprehend how difficult it would be without this convenience at access to money in emergencies or cases when money is needed .
it is also a convenience which helps to save time , which is very important to working men and women of the late 1900 &apos;s .
this machinery also permits you to do your banking when you wish rather than the assigned banking hours .
people may argue that ATM machines will take away employment in banks but we must also focus on the positive aspects .
ATM machines appear in all areas of the world .
in the United States , for example , you can find machines in stores , movie theatres , parking lots at shopping malls , and at banks .
in many situations I have either forgotten my wallet or not had enough money at the grocery store .
this is when I really appreciate my ATM card .
another advantage of the card is the danger of having large quantities of cash in your home or wallet .
this enti@@ ces robbers and can promote danger .
all in all , I feel ATM cards are an excellent invention . convenience has proved itself in many circumstances and I do not know what I would do without my card . -- The development of computerized technology has enhanced our environment by providing convenience and time saving activities which reduce the stress of our everyday life .
the Amazon L@@ ava li@@ zards are pretty hard to see .
when you saw one probably it already saw you .
I noticed in the field that the big males are more conspicuous than the juven@@ iles , the immature males and the females .
the adult males seemed to be in the same place always .
however , I ca n&apos;t confirm that there were the same males in the same places .
the smaller individuals had a tendency to run away quickly when they noticed someone coming .
also , they commonly go back to the same place just after they flee .
the li@@ zards can stand still for a long time with few movements , usually of the head .
the big ones showed more communicative displays like head@@ bo@@ bs and push - ups .
the boar@@ d@@ walk was the only point where I saw more than one animal which could interact with each other .
in other places , when there is more than one animal , they are away from one another and do n&apos;t interact .
the animals which use the boar@@ d@@ walk were more exposed than the animals of the other places .
the animals which I observed among the vegetation were usually shel@@ tered either by a dense sh@@ rub or bush <eos> , or on a br@@ ome@@ li@@ ad leaf that had spi@@ kes on the edge .
the distance to cause flee in these animals was larger than the boar@@ d@@ walk li@@ zards .
&quot; I feel like I should tell her the truth and beg for her forgiveness &quot; , Mark said to Michael .
their friend Jenny was going to be out of town for a few days and she asked Mark to take care of her cat while she was away .
he agreed to it , but he did n&apos;t really pay too much attention to the doors of his house being properly shut , so the animal escaped . &quot;
J@@ ules is nowhere to be found &quot; , he sighed .
&quot; I &apos;m just going to buy her a huge flowers bouquet and hope she does n&apos;t take it too hard &quot; .
Michael , however , thought his friend was over@@ reacting . &quot;
I &apos;ll fix this for him since he &apos;s too stupid to fix it himself &quot; , he thought .
he went into the first pet shop he found and bought a Si@@ am@@ ese cat which he thought looked identical to the one en@@ trusted to Mark . &quot;
dear Jenny , sorry I &apos;m having J@@ ules delivered to you , but I &apos;m busy and ca n&apos;t drop him off myself .
love , Mark &quot; , he wrote on the card accompanying the cat cage .
the next day , there was a loud thum@@ ping on the door .
it was Mark , and he was furious . &quot;
did you really think that Jenny would n&apos;t notice that it was n&apos;t her cat ?
and how dare you use my name on that card ?
now , she does n&apos;t want to talk to me ever again !
and neither do I ever want to talk to you again ! &quot; , he shouted as he quickly made his way off the porch .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
a film I want to recommend for our student club is the captain america and the winter soldier . it has a lot of adrenaline and emotions .
this film was launched on the 13 of March and it was a big success .
using Global Posi@@ tioning System , GPS , is popular in the modern world although GPS does not work that well in areas where the GPS signal is interf@@ ered .
consequently indoor navigation with GPS is not that good .
this paper aims to propose an alternative method to GPS to be used in indoor environments .
the methods developed in this paper use only the position of the Wi@@ re@@ less Access P@@ oin@@ ts , WA@@ P : s , and the signal strength , R@@ SS@@ I , recorded by the user in order to calculate the position of the device .
since today &apos;s computers and cellphones contain all the required hardware , a future adoption of these methods would not only be easy but also cost effective .
one of the methods proposed in this paper usually gives the user a position that is about five meters wrong .
therefore this method can not be used when a more precise estimation is needed .
however a weigh@@ ted average of these three methods together with different similar methods might enhance the accuracy .
at the beginning it is worth to think over what the phenomenon of shopping is .
some people claim that doing shopping gives them a lot of pleasure .
recently I met with an example of a woman who maintained that spending money helps her to calm down .
yes .
in my family , there are five people ; my dad , mum , older sister and younger brother .
all of them who always talk , share and support everything for me .
they are not only my family members but also my best friends .
when I was a child , my dad or mum usually took me to school by motorbike . I have beautiful memories for those of time .
they bought for me all nice things that were useful for studying , and made me interested in studying .
when I got a bad score , they did not blame me , instead they always said : &quot; we count on you &quot; , thus I never felt scared or worried whenever I did wrong thing and that made me so confident .
I often told them my story before going to sleep , whatever , like how i make friends with boy in class , how i got over a dog on the road , etc .
but after growing up , I was not so close to my parents . I have many activities outdoors with my siblings , such as exercise , travel ...
in that time , we get over all problem and get more understand each other .
so now I am overseas and I always think about my family as my best friends ever .
Hi , Dear Han@@ na
last summer I worked at the cinema . it was a very good experience for me . I enjoyed it so much because I met a lot of people from different countries and cultures . I worked there for about three months and the pay was satisfactory . in the cinema I learned a lot about name &apos;s films , which I did n&apos;t hear from my colleagues . it was very kind and friendly and after we finished our job we still had a good friend and spent time together going out for drink and sometimes for dinner .
I hope next year to do the same job because I love it and hope to do what again
in the future , public transport is no longer required as &quot; owning your own vehicle &quot; becomes very common .
the justi@@ fications behind are :
1 . the advanced technology reduces the costs of manufacturing and maintaining an automobile to a very affordable level ;
2 .
recognizing transportation as a necessity in daily life , the governments will provide subsidies to their residents who can not afford to own a car .
under the future social welfare scheme , a person who is earning an annual income below a specific thre@@ shold will be provided a car at no charge at all ; in addition to that , all the related maintenance costs such as gasoline , parking , insurance , and tuning will be re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed by the government .
3 . there is no need to get a driving licence for operating a car .
with the assistance of advanced global position system technology , we can just simply voice input the place we would like to go to , and the car will automatically bring you there at ease .
when will the day of &quot; no public transport &quot; come ?
we can not tell at this moment , but one thing is for sure - technology keeps changing our life and mode of living .
the airport in my city is not very far from my home but , at the same time , it is not easy to reach the city .
the more comfortable way is to have a private car , which is possible to take the highway and then the direction for the centre of the city .
my home is close to the central rail station and the most important buses stop in the metropolitan area .
as second option , there is a railway service from the airport to a secondary rail station .
here you have to get off and then to take a bus , the number 25 , with which it is possible to arrive in the centre of the city from where I can reach my home by foot .
another possible option is to use a taxi service but , in this case , the cost of the journey is the most expensive of all .
the two best choices to return home from the airport are to use the private car or to use the railway airport service with a very cheap service : I spend a bit of time and money more , but the journey is nice and comfortable , like the same trip with a private car .
I am a hi@@ ght and blonde girl who loves all spots but my favorite is basketball .
I enjoy this sport because it is very dynamic , it teaches me many things , such us being polite and very responsible , and above all , it is a group game and I love working as a team .
I would like to give one advice to someone who wants to start doing this sport . that is , always work as a team . that is , not only think of yourself , but always think of the best for the team .
the dor@@ bell rang .
when I opened the door , imagine my surprise when I saw that my brother &apos;s foot was covered in blood .
I was really upset .
he came in , and I helped him .
I told him that he must go to the hospital to take care of his foot but he did n&apos;t listen .
he was afraid that if he went to the hospital , our parents would find out about this .
I asked him how this happened and he told me that he fell off his motorcycle .
that &apos;s when I realised what was going on .
he did n&apos;t want our parents to know , because his godfather had just bought him a motorcycle and our mother was against this , but he did keep it in one condition , so he would be really careful .
I told him that we had to go to the hospital , even if that meant that our parents were gon na take his motorcycle away .
he understood that he had no choice , so he agreed .
I called my mum and told her everything that had happened .
she came over to our house and took my brother to the hospital .
I was really worried , but hopefully everything was alright .
the pie chart depicts different proportion of fuel type that generate energy in Florida 2007 compared with the forecast for 2017 .
overall , it is clear that Natural gas is the main energy generator for both years , while R@@ enew@@ ables and Oil come at the bottom of the list .
for example , the energy generated by Natural gas increased from 38@@ .@@ 8% in 2007 to 5@@ 4.@@ 4% in 2017 .
next comes the energy production by Co@@ al which accounts for 29@@ .@@ 3% of the energy market in 2007 , followed by a drop of 5.@@ 6% in the fore@@ ca@@ sted year of 2017 .
as for Nuclear , although it represents the third energy generator in Florida for both compared years , the trend here is up@@ wards reaching 15@@ .9% at the estimated period .
in contrast , there is a significant drop in energy production for both Oil and Other sources in the two separate years from 6.@@ 7% to 1.@@ 1% for the former and 11.@@ 1% to 3.@@ 4% for the latter .
as for the R@@ enew@@ ables , the decrease in fuel generated over the period is less dramatic .
there are some reasons to explain how Venus shines so brightly according to the text .
in addition to these reasons , in the passage there is information about Venus temperature , and the listening passage can refuse some information that is expressed in the text .
some questions are done during the listening to expand the information about this planet .
how Venus can be so hot if it is recovered by thick white clouds , it should be could , should n&apos;t it ?
there is another doubt about this high temperature : there is a planet closer to the sun , that is hotter than Venus , so , it is n&apos;t hot because of your loc@@ alization near .
the most amazingly question is : how can it be hot in a place that sul@@ fi@@ ric acid prevents the sun from inside in ?
the listening passage could link the information in the text , and estim@@ ate some questions , and also give the answers to make the reader more curious about the topic .
there are many problems facing both road and rail transport in the UK .
the most talked about issues concerning roads are probably congestion and safety .
congestion is most appar@@ ant around major con@@ urb@@ ations such as London , Gre@@ ater Manchester and Birmingham .
the simple way to solve this problem would be to either build more roads or make the present ones larger .
however this , as seen in recent events , for example New@@ bury , has been met with strong opposition from environmental groups and local residents .
another way to reduce congestion , especially in the large cities , could be to persuade people not to use their vehicles at all .
introducing schemes such as the &apos; park - and - ride &apos; scheme and encouraging people to use bicycles would certainly reduce the number of cars on the road .
safety is often talked about as a priority factor concerning roads .
too many accidents occur because of dangerous driving on busy roads .
there are several ways to combat this problem .
although the legal limit for drinking while driving has just been increased , lowering the limit by several units would deter many people from using their own vehicles and instead encourage them to use public transport .
increasing the amount of law enforcement could also be effective , giving the police more rights to make arre@@ sts and increasing the number of speed cameras as well as possibly giving larger fines .
cutting down on the national speed limit may also encourage drivers to take more care .
the condition of roads is often a local issue rather than of national concern .
it is therefore up to the local council to maintain their roads better , especially in winter .
this may require the local council obtaining more money from the government .
safety is much less of a factor for rail transport .
here the major talking point is efficiency .
it is often noted that trains are delayed and are rarely running on time .
because of this in@@ efficiency , many rail customers are turning to other forms of transport . cars mostly fly , but for long distance journeys , flying is an increasingly attractive option .
a large amount of blame for this in@@ efficiency goes to the actual trains which are in most cases out of date and slower than modern ones such as the French T@@ GV or the Japanese &apos; bullet &apos; train .
the train tracks can also be blamed , as they are often in a state of repair and this inevitably delays trains .
it is hoped that the recent priv@@ ati@@ sation of British R@@ ail will bring in more up to date trains and increase the overall efficiency of travelling by train in a bid to attract much more customers .
the author in reading part thought technology brings us more comfortably live .
the author took an example ; one is we do n&apos;t have to eat raw meat nowadays because someone discovered how to use fire . second is we do n&apos;t have to live in cave anymore .
however , the professor disagrees with the author .
she thinks technology not all lets us better , oppos@@ itely it lets us worse .
she said technology brings us weak relationships with family or friends .
and then it even makes our circumstances worse because it causes a lot of pollution .
finally , the professor suggests that we have to reduce using technology .
if we reduce using it , we will have a good relationship and a better environment .
apparently , the author did n&apos;t notice the bad influence from technology .
in this essay I will put forward and briefly break down the controversy which involves problems related to zoos .
as a controversial topic , there are arguments for and against it .
depending on the point of view that each person might take , the argument they will give .
it is very likely that animals in zoos suffer from not being in their natural habitat , being stared at almost all the time , not having the space they require to live comfortably and the natural peace they need to live in .
furthermore , it is also but not only important to say that the fact that its animals live in groups and , in contrast to that , in zoos its number is limited to a few of them .
nevertheless , for society and especially for children , it is very useful to have the possibility of going and experiencing a visit to a zoo .
if it were not because of the zoos it would be practically impossible that wild animals could be known by the majority of the population .
this experience provides a wide range of possibilities not only for children but also for the big ones , such as ve@@ ts , Scienti@@ fic@@ s and why not anthrop@@ ologists too .
all in all , it would be difficult to take a fair solution , or almost to provide a solution which would deal with both oppos@@ ites &apos; sides of the topic in question .
in my personal opinion , I think Safari parks would be a solution in the middle of these oppos@@ ites &apos; sides ; they would provide a better quality of life for animals and would be an educational way as well .
firstly , what is the European Union ?
it seems to have two distinct forms of which one seems to worry the British public most ; Political Union , followed by Economic and Mon@@ etary Union .
in fact these issues have become so heated in Great Britain at present that they have led to many disputes within the present government .
they also appear to be one of the major reasons for the resignation of Mrs. Tha@@ t@@ cher .
in losing her , have we not already lost a part of our sovereignty ?
Europe is forcing change upon us as we have been attempting to stand back , &quot; not letting soci@@ alism in by the back door &quot; , instead of playing an important role in positively affecting the decision making processes - or in the European Community .
great Britain can not afford to play a minor role in a two speed Europe especially in the time of recession at present , and this has mani@@ fested itself in the top governmental disputes .
so , a loss of sovereignty seems inevitable , whether we like it or not .
in the monetary and economic Union , I do n&apos;t feel that we have much to lose ; in fact , on the contrary , I think that we would benefit enormously , especially in the light of 1992 .
if only the issue were presented in a more positive light , perhaps with some modifications , I am sure that the British public would give their agreement .
after all , how long has it been since we lost our sovereignty to the fol@@ lies of the international Sto@@ ck exchanges of New York , Tokyo and Frankfurt ?
will losing our sovereignty to Brussels or the Bun@@ des@@ bank make much difference ?
did not the &quot; Big Bang &quot; in October 1987 send shock waves world wide with share prices plum@@ me@@ ting ?
world processes are continuously becoming more and more inter@@ linked ; the effects of which often see no physical borders .
I therefore see this European Un@@ ity as a natural process in World development , something which should be made easier rather than hindered .
can we really afford to play for time by drag@@ ging our feet ?
the issue of Political Union is still more disputed .
yes , we have a Queen and what would happen to her - would she be forced to ab@@ dic@@ ate and be succeeded by King J@@ acqu@@ es Del@@ ors ?
this is a very typical mi@@ sin@@ formed and ignorant statement posed by certain British &quot; patri@@ ots &quot; .
there are five other Mon@@ archs in the European Community and their status to a great extent will not be greatly affected by any such Union .
but there is a true cause for concern about Br@@ us@@ sel@@ s@@ &apos;@@ bureau@@ cracy which ri@@ ghtly worries the British public .
this situation must be changed to rid the Council of its sec@@ rec@@ y and to transfer greater power to the European Parliament for a more democratic system .
this will mean that everyone will have a fair say in what goes on - something which must be guaranteed for such indepen@@ dant thin@@ kers as the Bri@@ tons themselves .
an answer to Bri@@ tains reservation on European Un@@ ity , which I find most plausible at present ; a Federal Union which would ensure decisions where possible would be taken at local levels .
this , if properly carried out , would enable us to keep our cultural identity - the ultimate element of our sovereignty .
dementia is a kind of normal disease for the elderly .
and it is difficult to be cured by humans , so robotics is used to help them .
for this case , at this monument research reported that :
social commitment robots are designed to promote therap@@ eutic interactions through
communication and social interaction .
the therap@@ eutic use of the robots attempts to
reach out to people affected by dementia and may provide an alternative mode of
engagement with this population .
( Mor@@ do@@ ch et al , 2013 , p. 15 )
consequence : these robotics offer the benefit to patients who associated with personal interactions , enabling them to be pleasure and relaxed .
especially , in Japan , people are keen on using robotic surgery to care for the aging population . the reason for this is that home cares or hospitals can not allow animal assisted therapy to enter .
unlike Japan , in North American , people prefer to use animal assisted therapy , but the use of robotics is less than animals .
I &apos;ve been a member of the Active Leisure Club since 7th April 2013 and I &apos;m really pleased with your letter , because it means that you care about your customers .
what I really appreciate is the staff qualification , particularly of the fitness courses and their punctuality .
this aspect is really important for working people .
I have to congratulate you on the cleanliness of the environments : everything is always perfect and I often see showers being s@@ ani@@ tized and people do have respect for every common space .
I also have some suggestions .
it would be really useful having some hair@@ dr@@ yers in the locker rooms : in this way , people could have a complete service and could arrive at home relaxed or ready to go out .
another service that could make you competitive with other centres would be having a massage room : after any sport , it would be nice to have a personal mas@@ se@@ ur who takes care of your tired body !
anyway , I &apos;m really glad to have a leisure club in my city that helps me to keep fit !
thank you for your interest .

Mary J@@ AM@@ ES
Mary James and I met at Mari@@ ani@@ sta school .
we have gone to secondary school together and we have been friends for 5 years , so we know each other very well .
when Mary was at secondary school , she proved herself to be a brilliant student .
she not only was competent , but also hard - working and that was reflected on her high grades .
nevertheless , she was not bo@@ ast@@ ful , and in contrast , she would help other students who had some difficulties with the subjects .
she was appreciated by students and teachers because of her kindness and her willingness to help .
Mary is extremely loyal to her friends .
she is also caring and supportive and she knows exactly what to say when you are going through a tough situation .
moreover , she is a very enthusiastic and energetic person , and whenever she sets an objective she accompli@@ shes it .
when Mary was a student , she was very self - demanding , who wished to do everything perfect and , as a result , she was sometimes overwhelmed .
however , as years went by , she managed to handle those situations , as she learnt how to organize and do her tasks in a more efficient way .
Mary was always interested in British culture and therefore she has studied English for several years and she has read many books about Great Britain .
as she has finished high school , her intention is to pursue a career and she is looking for a possibility that would enable her to achieve her goal as well as develop her English - speaking skills .
it is clear that the post you are seeking to fill would suit her undoubtedly and I have no hesitation in supporting her application .
yours faithfully ,

would you like to find out the best place for our last dinner ?
firstly , we must look for a restaurant special for groups , because there are a large number of people .
if we go to a normal restaurant , we will dislike the treatment .
I am sure there are some restaurants where we would be able to go .
I am going to explain what is my favourite for this special occasion .
I suggest &apos; Pom@@ mod@@ oro &apos; .
this is an Italian restaurant , which is located in the city centre .
both characteristics are the most important for me .
first of all , this kind of food likes most people , such as pizza or mac@@ car@@ oni .
also , the location is perfect because we can arrive easily , walking or by bus .
after dinner , we may go to some discos or pubs .
besides , this restaurant has a delightful decor .
it seems you are sitting in a rom@@ an theatre .
the waiters are from Italy , so they may talk with us in Italian , which would be very useful for practising this language .
in conclusion , I would recommend this restaurant .
it is the ideal place for us , a big place , delicious food and the location , of course .
nowadays , film stars , musicians , politicians , models live in the li@@ me@@ light .
some of them want it and some of them are less enthusiastic about being in the centre of attention .
journalists often follow them all the time .
in my opinion celebrities have a right to a private life , but as long as they do n&apos;t tell everything about themselves in the tabloids .
first of all , everyone has a right to privacy .
being a famous artist or politician is an unusual job , but still only a job , and after the job everyone wants to have their own life .
on the other hand , being a superstar , it &apos;s almost impossible to have a private life .
well - known people are frequently in touch with their fans and most of the public know them very well .
in my point of view , everyone has a right to privacy with no exceptions .
journalists who follow celebrities just cross the line .
the paparazzi often exceed the limit of privacy .
we do n&apos;t have to know everything about them . for example , the hair condition of some actress when she was shopping .

superstars also deserve to have their own life . no one deserves to be followed or spi@@ ed on .
Colombia &apos;s army is a good stereotype to other ar@@ mies in Latin America , even other ar@@ mies of the world .
even so , many Colombi@@ ans do not know the hard work of their soldiers day by day must be made for the only purpose of protecting our lives and guarantee democracy for all of us .
therefore , it is necessary to know why Colombian &apos;s army has this distinction .
first , the military forces of Colombia have 4@@ 38@@ .@@ 700 effec@@ tives , being the largest army in Latin America , followed by Brazil .
on the other hand , Colombian &apos;s army is regarded as one of the best ar@@ mies in the world due to its internal conflict , that keeps the soldiers in action and constant training . even in Colombia , they are training other Latin American ar@@ mies from Africa and the Middle East because of the war anti@@ - terrorist that develops the Colombian armed forces for 40 years . these have been strengthened in a master@@ ly manner , by its preparation , intelligence and modern t@@ actic aids .
second , it is necessary to highlight some of the work performed by our army in anti - terrorism struggle such as : fo@@ iling terrorist attacks , neutr@@ alizing explos@@ ive devices left in urban areas and rural areas , preventing the recruitment of children , realizing medical Bri@@ gad@@ es for helping farmers and , most important , offering their lives if it &apos;s necessary to protect each and every one of us , even without knowing us .
finally , I could say that the hard work and the good image that has the Colombian army just reflect our wish to live in peace .
likewise , all Colombian people want to achieve their dreams in a pacific way , without weapons or fights between brothers and so , showing the world that the Colombian people are brave enough to fight for peace .
dear Paul ,
what &apos;s up ? .
sorry I did n&apos;t answer your letter earlier .
I was really busy because of the organization of the next concert .
by the way , your VIP tickets are waiting in the drawer in my desk .
as you asked me , I &apos;ll write to you something about helping Kok@@ on &apos;s concert which took place last month .
it was a huge challenge for me because I was responsible for almost everything .
just at the beginning I had a problem with the owner of the pub .
he was n&apos;t convinced that we &apos;d be able to sell as many tickets to pay for the pub .
he did n&apos;t know the band , was really sc@@ ep@@ tical about it .
but , you know , where there &apos;s a will there &apos;s a way and at last I won him over .
when he came to the pub an hour before the concert to see how things were working he was just speechless with surprise .
his pub was full of people ( as never before ) .
I did n&apos;t tell him that ever though Kok@@ on is quite an underground band , it has so many fans ! .
his face expression almost killed me when I saw it .
it was a mix of outr@@ age because of the crowd in his pub and happiness because of the money they spent on beer .
and how about the concert ?
it was incredible .
although I had to take care of everything I could have a great time too .
we are planning next events with Kok@@ on &apos;s leader .
I &apos;ll let you know about concerts coming up this month .
just tell me when you are going to come back to By@@ tom .
kisses ,
W@@ y@@ dra
she started her life with so many problems , and after every sadness period , she discovers that she has enough capability to continue .
but the most difficult thing in her perspective is when she is exposed to losing someone . however , she has lost many people in varying circumstances , but she never used to the feeling of losing , and she pains each time , such as the first time .
she experiences travelling , and she attempts to leave everything which causes her sadness . she tries to keep away from politics , and removes the military and weapons image from her mind , but humans &apos; blood has chased her .
she was writing about each important event .
I think that nowadays most people use public transport little .
I understand that the car is more comfortable and safe to travel and to make short trips . however , this is more dangerous for the environment .
people of some countries use different modes of transport , for example a bike or train to get to the city .
scientists around the world are investigating genetic manipulation for a wide variety of beneficial causes .
genetic Engineering is , however , a very raw issue and there is a lot of resistance to this work and certainly the suggestions of using it on humans .
the trouble is that although a scientist may think he knows a lot about a particular area of study , and indeed he may , there is still so much that we do not know about areas of study like genetics that there is a great fear of the unexpected .
and indeed this fear is justified .
when we consider the horrific effects of a nuclear h@@ olocaust , I am sure there are many who wish it had never been discovered .
but are we right to blame the scientists who first started the research and who had no ideas for it to be used as a weapon ?
we can argue that surely the scientist must have the greatest realisation of the uses of the discovery good or bad since he is the expert on the subject .
but are we right to blame him ?
let us consider that he has discovered a cure for cancer as a result of genetic engineering .
it is against human nature to stop at this stage and ask , should I introduce what could be the greatest medical discovery of our lifetime when I am not 100% sure of the consequences .
can we expert a scientist to bear this additional burden for the whole world ?
in truth no , it is unreasonable .
genetic engineering is developing rapidly and already has been used extensively in plants and bacteria not@@ ably for the production of resistant str@@ ains of plants and in the production of human insulin .
the natural step forward now is to apply this knowledge to treat common genetic disorders like Down &apos;s Syndrome .
there is a lot of resistance to this and fears that we may manufacture mut@@ ants or that somebody may produce an army of super@@ human cl@@ ones .
some of these may seem a little far fet@@ ched but it is conceivable that in 100 years &apos; time we may be able to decide the characteristics of our child , whether he is a great piano player or sportsman .
it does not seem morally right to be able to make these decisions and certainly to anyone religious would be seen to be interf@@ ering in the ways of god and something to be avoided at all costs .
a great scientist can not see into the future .
he can not gage the moral re@@ pur@@ c@@ usions of his discovery nor the long term effect it is going to have on the world .
if he is doing research for what he considers to be a good cause , who are we to critici@@ se him when we know far less about it ?
provided a scientist &apos;s work has been permitted and is public , I feel it is un@@ just to hold him responsible for what the world will make of his work .
to avoid continually writing he / she , his / her the scientist in this essay has been referred to as he .
I hope no offence is taken from this .
dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing in response to the invitation to share my experience of making a hard decision that appeared in the July issue of your English - language magazine .
as a nineteen - year - old student I have gained familiarity with this topic by deciding which course of studies I am going to choose .
first of all , I strongly believe that making choices is always risky as people do not know what the exact result will be .
like most adolescents , I was at a total loss when the time of deciding what I wanted to be in the future came .
in despair I applied for two courses of studies , which did not resemble at all , which made the moment of choosing a lot harder .
knowing that not only was this choice a fundamental decision , but it was also one that will influence the rest of my adulthood , I appealed for help in what should I focus on at the moment of making my decision .
as time passed by , I was to attend more and more classes .
I could not cope with such a busy timetable and consequently I was exhausted and stressed .
a decision had to be made before I dropped out of both courses of studies .
I bore in mind the pieces of advice I was given and chose what made me happy despite not having the approval of some of my relatives .
I am convinced that star@@ k choices are unavoidable but in order to not regret the consequences they might have , either positive or negative , people should choose what makes them happier .
however , I have not given for granted that my decision will not make me regret .
if this were the case , I know that I am always on time to start again .
for the above mentioned reasons , I think choices have to be carefully considered before being made .
even though this does not assure the results .
I look forward to following subsequent articles on related issues .
yours faithfully ,
Vil@@ ma Ros@@ sit
there are many standards by which success and hard work have been measured and rewarded in the past .
in earlier times people had the lifestyle of f@@ ending for themselves .
they were not aff@@ or@@ ded the many lux@@ uries that have become common@@ place in our present society .
because of the differences in personalities and ambition , I feel it is vital that in today &apos;s society men and women should be financially rewarded for their individual efforts .
in a society , each person has the same basic needs for survival .
long ago the quest for fulfillment of these needs took up the majority of each person &apos;s day .
in order to feed your family you had to plant .
in order to live you had to build .
to have clothing , you had to sew .
each hour of each day was devoted to meeting these needs .
even in early times , the harder you worked , the more food , shelter or clothing you gained .
this is a very simple support of reward equ@@ aling effort .
bringing this to a more present time , we are now re@@ aping the benefits of advanced technology , expanding knowledge , and modern times .
we have many machines to help us meet our food , clothing and shelter needs with little or no effort on our part , it would appear .
persons with great technical minds are using their talent on the job and paying someone to do their labor .
however , just as in earlier days , the harder you work , the greater the reward .
let &apos;s imagine a society where all men and women were treated equal .
all basic survival needs ( and even wants for that matter ) were provided regardless of the effort put forth . I would venture to guess that we would not be as advanced of a society as we are today .
competitiveness and jeal@@ ously would set in and fights would occur .
worst case scenario : the world would become divided or even destroyed because someone was sitting on the si@@ del@@ ines and not doing their share .
we would not have motivation to develop our talents and abilities and to use them in a way to benefit others .
our society would become selfish and ho@@ ar@@ ding and our culture would suffer .
it may be a pessimistic view , but I feel a very real view , to say that we would become lazy and stag@@ nate people .
life is about rewards .
it is about learning where you are and how you can move yourself to the next level .
each of us is measured daily by some scale of achievement .
effort is vital to success , motivation is the key to effort .
some are content with needs , others want more , much more !
our system of rewards is money ... but is it really about money ?
I do n&apos;t think so .
it &apos;s about meeting needs ( and even wants ! ) and how much one is willing to give for the opportunity for something better .
dear Sir or Madam ,
my name &apos;s Ci@@ prin@@ a Pi@@ res and I am 17 years old .
I &apos;m writing to you because I have seen the advertisement for a jog on a summer camp in the USA and I would like to make my application for the job .
I like to work with children between 8 - 12 years old because they have energy for everyone and might understand some of the activities that we will be given to them .
normally , I like to organise activities for others and they might be interesting and different .
I love organising evening activities more than the other ones because they are more exciting and more enthusiastic .
now , I have been cooking for my family and I love it , and I would love to cook for 100 people .
I can speak English enough that all the people can understand . I &apos;m energetic , hardworking and cheerful .
........@@ ....@@ ....
yours sincerely ,

the impact on modern biology was enormous and for this reason , in 1993 the inventor was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry .
for this invention Mul@@ l@@ is received a bonus of $ 10000 from the company he was working for , but in a short time the rights to use the process made the company 300 million dollars !
the television is , for many people , the main way to spend their free time .
children stay , in a day , more than one hour watching the television .
parents are worried about what their children watch because they think that their sons do not learn anything , it only entertains .
it is far from really .
if we choose the correct programs we could make them teach us a lot in@@ adver@@ tently .
there are a lot of documentaries about the environment , animals , human bodies , etc , which are very interesting and entertaining .
cartoons can be put into English or other languages to improve them .
the TV can be used to leave a blank mind or a full brain with a lot of useful knowledge .
now the stone is on their roofs .
plastic bags are banned in the city .
town council are planting more trees .
solar heater has been introduced in the houses instead of water heater .
rain water storage system to increase water level .
human wastage is properly handled by town council .
governments are encouraging people to use public transport instead of a car .
using cycle is more friendly envir@@ ent@@ metal vehicle .
led lights are introduced to reduce electricity usage .
change is always good .
it is widely accepted that change is an essential motor of progress .
in fact , for many people , without changes , mankind would live still as in pre@@ history , without fire , wheels , or even comfortable houses . we would live in caves , would n&apos;t we ?
we would only eat that our men would hunt .
we would wear animal leather .
Oh !
what a ridiculous drawing !
but in my opinion , the problem is more complex .
conservative people , for instance , usually are reluctant to change , because in general they are afraid of changing , probably because they prefer bad things but sure things .
in addition , if you have a glance at history , in spite of times of revolution usually being traumatic , humanity tends to improve after them .
the question is if con@@ vul@@ sion , violence , and wars that often change need to be done really wh@@ or@@ th ?
it is often said that public transport is bound to disappear since most people seem to be pleased to use their own car for nearly every journey they take .
this might probably be true for the majority of people .
sure enough , if asked , most people would say they prefer travelling by car to using public transport . travelling by car offers many advantages .
for instance , you can decide exactly the time you want to leave , and the place you want to leave from .
you do not have to share your journey with anybody if you do not want to and you can get to the exact point where you want to be .
everything about cars seems to be an advantage .
so , why does public transport still exist ?
to begin with , because not everybody can own a car .
but even if everybody could , it would be a nightmare to try to get to a big city , such Barcelona , by car .
I do not think there would be enough space for so many vehicles , not only to park but also to circulate on the road .
moreover , the level of pollution would be so high that I doubt anybody could survive it .
the future
the problems of this plant are increasing every day and people ask themselves : what will the future be like in 30 years ?
we think that the world will be destroyed .
at first many kinds of plant species will have become extinct , 90% percent of fa@@ una will be endangered .
after that food will have become insufficient to satisfy society demands and people will be dying of starvation . diseases will be more common and a lot of people will have died due to epide@@ m@@ ics .
an appreci@@ able part of society will have been diagnosed with cancer .
living in a eg@@ al@@ it@@ arian society , people will be collabor@@ ating to save the world . we will be using robots to clean the planet . scientists will design special clothes to avoid radiation , and people will be using oxygen tanks .
living in our current society is divided in social status .
poor people will be living in the trash and rich people will be living inside spacecraft .
there will be wars in order to get water .
once you become famous you probably will definitely know the taste and the price of fame .
there are many people in my country who keep thinking that being a famous person to some extent is a blessing .
such person is known for most of the people within national or even international rate .
some believe that there are many advantages to being a celebrity or widely known person , though there are a number of disadvantages as well .
first of all , many local and world known celebrities claim to have no private life .
being famous means that probably most of your life journalists , your neighbours and ordinary people will be interested in your life .
most of the time , it is impossible to avoid this kind of attention .
people are curious and they admire their favourite stars &apos; lives by reading magazines , watching TV or surfing the Internet .
moreover , such yellow press col@@ um@@ ns with the title &apos; celebrities &apos; hit the selling records , giving a huge benefit for the publishing companies .
millions of people are able to buy magazines with celebrities on the covers , although some photos give the readers some &apos; additional &apos; , and not the most pleasant details .
people are interested almost in everything : the articles about break - ups , drug abuse , young celebrities , questionable relationships , or even the special ones with naked celebrity photos .
this is more than sharing some of your private life details , most of the press people look for scandals and their aim is to un@@ cover the most intimate secrets .
secondly , being successful and famous also requires the person to be good at his or her job .
the &apos; star &apos; is followed not only by the public eye , he or she is also evaluated by producers and future employing companies .
there is no doubt that celebrities work hard to achieve fame , better and desirable jobs , including supreme salaries .
the majority of celebrities have their personal managers , who take care of their image .
so even if you are rich and famous , it does not always mean that you will be able to live and act as you would like to .
fame has another side . there are strict requirements for actors , singers , etc . , which appear as they sign contracts with the companies , which provide their jobs .
attending some events , or parties may be a necessity and depend not always on the wishes of a celebrity .
also , it is said that fame spo@@ ils people and they struggle with their personal problems . only it is even more difficult to help them , than to any ordinary people .
sometimes there are cases when the lack of a private life leads to more serious issues .
we all know that some well known people become engaged in illegal activities , start using drugs or alcohol , as well as join some mysterious religious groups .
sometimes they even become suicidal just because they can not live under constant pressure .
even if being in the public eye is not always very pleasant , there are a number of advantages . why is it worth fing fing a little of your private life ?
going deep into the public entertainment world , which is definitely rewarding , gives you a lot of benefits .
most celebrities do not work all their lives , although the money they gain during their careers ( sometimes it is a very short period of success ) allow them to live without any worries .
giving away some personal life details , while you are famous , may bring you fortune .
for example , many celebrities sell their baby born photos to magazines , as they offer enormous sums of money , in order to get a tiny glimpse into their family life .
moreover , being a famous person means that you are able to influence other people , especially young generations .
by setting a good example celebrities may become idols and inspire other people to live and help others who are in need .
by donating money to ch@@ arities , as well as being involved with volunteering projects is one of the things you can do when you are wealthy and famous .
to summarise , fame comes with many disadvantages , as well as it has a number of advantages .
celebrities have different experiences .
their lives seem to be glam@@ orous and they look gorgeous , though you will never know what is under the &apos; beautiful and sparkling cover &apos;
shopping Online
currently , with the internet having penetr@@ ated in our lives , shopping online enjoys great popularity among us , especially for young people .
although some deny shopping online for the virtual of the internet , I , un@@ hesit@@ at@@ ingly , am hooked on it .
first of all , we enjoy more convenient and time - saving shopping online .
for example , time and space could not be taken into account if we shop online .
since we want to purchase something , we can shop online .
as is well - known , there is no shutdown at online stores .
in addition , walking for a long time and distance could be avoided if we shop online .
because once we place an order , the merchant will dispat@@ ch the goods immediately .
meanwhile , it &apos;s more easy to buy quality and inexpensive goods through the internet .
thanks to displays of the feedback of the customs and the merchants &apos; reputation on the webpage for us , we can value the goods directly and pick out the goods , to some extent , from the vast range of goods that we eager for online .
finally , shopping online plays an essential role in our lives because of its convenience and flexibility .
in other words , Shopping online does really perfect our lives .
I believe that it will be more whole@@ some and guaranteed with the optimi@@ zing of the network market .
dear USA Summer Camp ,
I want to have this job because I like children , being outside , and I am a person who works a lot if it is necessary at night .
I am very good at organising activities suitable for children . also last year I went to a campsite that taught me how to prepare activities for children . it also taught me how to work with children .
last year I went to cooking lessons . I learnt how to prepare food suitable for children . also , I know how to prepare desserts for adults and for children .
I &apos;m a nice person , funny and sociable with children .
at the moment , public transport is used but many people are starting to travel much more using their own cars instead of travelling by public transport , which , in my opinion , is better to use .
one reason for my opinion is that on a bus , train , railway , etc . we can fit more people than in a car or on a motorbike , so we pollute less because we use all the same vehicle instead of using each person one car or one motorbike , which will pollute much more . as always , things have a price , but there is a question that must be asked . is it worth paying to save our ecosystem or even our lives ?
I think so and , besides , it is much cheaper than buying a car and will use petrol per month or less . another reason I prefer to use public transport is because I have to adapt to a schedule , so I would not be late at the place I want to go , besides that , bus stops are some codes that are used to see how long it is to catch the next bus .
to conclude , public transport is much better than using a car or a motorbike , but people ca n&apos;t see it .
terrorism is the use to fear and acts of violence in order to in@@ timi@@ date societies or governments .
many different types of social or political organizations might use terrorism to try to achieve their goals .
it is difficult to define terrorism .
terrorism has no official criminal law definition at the international level .
common definitions of terrorism refer to violent acts which are intended to create fear ( terror ) ; are done for a religious , political , or ide@@ ological goal ; and which target civilians .
some definitions now include acts of un@@ law@@ ful violence and war .
the use of similar tactics by criminal gangs is not usually called terrorism , though these same actions may be called terrorism when done by a politically motivated group .
best friends are meant to be forever .
in that sense , family will be there with us forever .
but , what if they are not that close to you ?
what if they keep you pam@@ per@@ ed always ?
of course you will feel irritated , especially at teenage .
family protects us , gives care but it &apos;ll be irritating if they do the same when you grow up .
they should give you some space for yourself .
when you are a child , you love to be with your parent@@ s@@ ;@@ love hanging with them ar@@ ound@@ .@@ once you come across your childhood change the same track to friends , consider them as your every@@ thing@@ .@@ keeping in mind that only family will be there with you in the worse .
I think they have changed since there are more and more fat kids by the day .
Portugal is one of European countries with more fat kids , with a little higher amount of fat kids than Spain and Ireland .
eastern European countries are the ones with less fat kids , maybe an influence of former communist rule ?
when you do n&apos;t have anything to eat , you do n&apos;t get fat and , consequently , you do n&apos;t get filled with diseases that are common in fat people , like diabetes .
that &apos;s the only , although un@@ intended , upside of communi@@ sm over capitalism .
although it would be amusing for me to continue to sla@@ g off communi@@ sm , let &apos;s not go there .
the topic is about eating habits , a thing that is always eradicated , alongside health and prosperity , when communi@@ sts gain power over countries .
Bang !
nowadays in my country people eat a lot of the same unhealthy food that other people eat in the rest of the Western countries .
we used to eat a lot of co@@ d@@ f@@ sh , the stereotyp@@ ical Portuguese food , and we still do , but now we also eat a lot of fast food , and that &apos;s part of the reason we have so many fat kids .
when I was a kid , fifteen years ago , the kids used to be slim .
when I entered the first grade , there was n&apos;t a single fat kid in the class .
today , 32@@ % of kids are fat .
in the time period of just twenty years we became one of the countries in Europe with more fat kids .
so yes , eating habits have changed dramatically in my country , but we may get back our good old slim sil@@ hou@@ e@@ ttes after our - probably - new government , a co@@ ali@@ tion of sociali@@ sts and communi@@ sts , takes office .
food , everybody loves it , some people hate it also - those who ca n&apos;t control themselves and suffer the consequences to their health of over@@ eating .
lack of self - control is a very sad thing .
fortunately , I do n&apos;t have that problem .
I &apos;m lacking inspiration to write , but I will try , because I have to .
eating habits in my country .
I already talked about the fat kids who eat shit that makes them fat .
shitty food is trendy in my country , like I said , but that &apos;s true for every European country , like I also said .
but I guess it is better than eating roots and animal cor@@ p@@ ses , like our hom@@ in@@ id ancestors ate millions of years ago .
Hunter - gather@@ es thousands of years ago ate roots too , but they did n&apos;t have to eat rot@@ ting flesh because they hunt animals - like the first half of their name suggests ... I know I really look like an idiot by writing this kind of thing , but that only proves that I was telling the truth when I said I &apos;m lacking inspiration .
I &apos;ve been reading Mil@@ ton &apos;s Paradise Lost , first because I wanted to read it for its literary significance , second because I want to improve my English , and reading in it is a good way to achieve that goal .
I &apos;m only in the First Book .
it &apos;s an excellent work , of course .
I thought I would have trouble compreh@@ ending Mil@@ ton &apos;s English , because , you know , its not English you hear from the average and con@@ tempor@@ aneous English speaker , but it turns out it &apos;s a much easier read than I thought .
I find Shakespeare harder , although , with a bit of a fight , I manage to get it too , but not always , at least for now .
dear 230 year - old me , I am only 15 now and I haven&apos;t lived enough .
I am just a kid , I am not complete yet , I have a lot to discover and to shape in my life .
I have no idea how I am going to get there . I am now in my bed studying for my tests tomorrow but I guess in 2@@ 15 years from now it wo n&apos;t matter .
I really wonder how it feels to live that long , are n&apos;t you bored of living ?
do you ever wish you were dead ?
I bet you have the God complex , you must feel powerful ...
but do you ?
or perhaps you feel weak , vulnerable , dead inside , lost ... You have lived for so long more than anyone should .
of course living like this must have consequences , what is it like in your head ?
how do you look ?
what do you think of yourself ?
are you happy about what you have become ?
of what you have done ?
what is the price of being you ?
did you really give up everything to have what you have ?
do you ever regret it ?
do you feel lonely ?
what are you doing with your cold heart ?
is there anything capable of un@@ fro@@ zing it ?
I dreamt of you , you know ?
we were in a forest , the sun was at the top of the sky , the birds were singing , I could hear the sound of the water falling , it was a heav@@ enly place , it was beautiful , then you were there , behind a tree , you did n&apos;t say a word , we just got closer , you were looking into my eyes , so was I , and then I put my right hand on your cheek , and at that moment I felt you , your skin , your soul , your existence .
and it lasted for a few moments , it was magical .
I guess we are going to meet only in one place , in Heaven , we are not supposed to know each other on Earth .
not in our miserable mortal lives , it does not matter anyway .
I felt you in that dream and I would not change it to a thing .
I felt close to you .
and somehow , without even meeting you I fell in love with your existence .
and it kills me tonight that I will always have love in my heart for you , forever .
I will wee@@ p for you my love , day and night , even the time when my eyes wo n&apos;t let my tears slip away , my heart will always do it .
reckless , pretty and wild
I hated the teacher , Clara .
she taught history in 2@@ 000yen E.@@ S.@@ O@@ . She has short brown curly hair .
she always had a pon@@ y@@ tail .
Clara was serious and bossy .
she generally was shouting at everyone when she taught a lesson .
Clara was worse than Pil@@ ar , my teacher of English .
Pil@@ ar was kind and fantastic with children .
school &quot; Val@@ le del Am@@ bro@@ z &quot; is a small place .
it &apos;s has a small building located in the centre of village .
classes are sm@@ alls and pavi@@ lions too .
the quality of teachers was good although teachers have explained very poorly because students were not told very well .
I sometimes hated them because they did n&apos;t see the effort that we made to approve exams because we were so psy@@ ched for it .
the other reason why they hated it was that it was difficult to take exams and they were also demanding .
however , I have a great memory for all my teachers because I helped me pull it off .
I@@ sti@@ l dreaming that there will be ach@@ ance for me to make a trip around world . there are many ways to travel from one place to another , but I prefer doing that on abo@@ at or a train .... because on boat or train ican fill the win@@ dos on my face or my hand , ican hear the sound of birds above me , on the plan you can see only the blowing sky and nothing more ... it is a strange idea for me to be bet@@ w@@ en the earth and the sky .
not only does public transport have a future , but it also deserves a bright one .
despite the fact that travelling by car may be more comfortable , we all should be absolutely conscious that public transport ought to occupy a prime spot in our future movi@@ lity .
otherwise , the future of the Earth might be put in danger .
indeed , if we , as a civili@@ sed society , were aware of the problem of the greenhouse gases that are then and again emitted into the atmosphere , we would use public transport much more often .
in this way , the air pollution would be reduced as a consequence of the use of buses , trains or the underground , all of them public means of transport that can avoid the massive presence of special cars on our streets and roads .
apart from cutting down on polluting gases in the atmosphere , the safety of our roads would improve , as there would be fewer cars circul@@ ating throughout the country .
both effects would combine to offer a healthier environment , in which our children could grow up safely .
on top of that , there is no excuse to use public transport , as it has been remarkably improved over the last few years .
nowadays , it is almost possible to access any place at any time by public transport , er@@ asing , as a result , one of the main problems that public transport used to have for its potential users .
so if we are determined to preserve our beloved planet and make it a better place to live in , a definite good start would be to leave the car in the garage and take the bus .
the last film I saw was not new . in fact it is &quot; The O@@ ther@@ s@@ &quot;@@ .@@ It is the best horror and suspense film that I have ever seen in my life .
it is set in a small Engl@@ an island and it was situated in 19@@ 46 when the second war finished .
a crazy woman who is waiting for her husband .
she has the total obligation to protect her children because they are allergic to the light .
recently in the mansion three new servants appear , Bertha Mills , Mr Tu@@ ttle and Lydia .
strange things happen in the mansion .
at first the little girl ( son of Grace ) , Anne , heard and saw these strange things , but his mother and Nicholas ( brother@@ )@@ don@@ &apos;t believe him .
Anne all the time told his mother the strange things that she had seen , and Nicholas started too .
time passes and everyone in the house starts to feel these strange things .
at this moment Charles ( the husband and father ) returns to the house but one day disappears another time .
one day all the curtains in the house disappeared and this was serious because children were sick and they could n&apos;t receive sunlight .
I would recommend this film to anyone , because the story seems to be real .
the movie has excellent sound effects and transmit epic sensations .
as we discussed before the project was launched , that two - domain structure causes some problem and inconvenience both in management / maintenance and in collecting analy@@ tic ( google , etc . )
thus , using single - domain structure seems better , if it is possible to develop the site in such a way ( in combination of word@@ press c@@ ms and custom code ) .
now it &apos;s time to draw the line at all the consideration and take the final decision ( with SC@@ HE@@ ME included ) .
to ensure the relationship between members of the same species , movements of the proc@@ ession are specific to each and the female selec@@ ts the one that best takes .
both mates performed movements to show submission behavior and reach a cop@@ ulation .
before I start this pretty obvious presentation , I would like to tell you my own opinion : the well organized , good scheduling , and wide route transport - this is one and possible vari@@ ant to move in the city .
so , pluses of personal car : you are sure of the strangers and you are master of your route .
avoid time wasting for several stops and can reach your goal ( working place , shop or even suburb ski club ) much easier and faster .
and the above arguments are versus to their own car - this is expensive , not ecological , and you have to take care of your car ( parking , repair , insurance , cleaning ) and have to find a lot of money to get a car .
thus , the flexibility or the price this is the main question .
as soon as the problem of the price for your own car possession is solved , the sooner the question of public transport necessity will be raised again .
many people believe that public transport &apos;s future would not exist due to an incredible increase in new means of transport &apos;s sales - side@@ ways , electric cars or bicycles .
for this reason , people wonder if normal means of transport could disappear because of this new transport tendency .
in my opinion , I am completely sure that public transport is the best option to move in the city for several reasons .
first of all , and taking into account the financial crisis , public transport , like the bus or underground , is the cheapest way to travel or even move in your own city .
overall , if you add not only the petrol price , also the maintenance , services , insurance and pay a few but expensive taxes .
in addition , Everybody knows that there are more people on a bus than in a car , so consequently , pollution produced is less .
by contrast , it is true that many places do not have good communication and it could take you quite a long time to get there .
but imagine if everyone had a car , nobody could arrive on time for their work .
on balance , public transport is the best option to move in the city .
but maybe , if communication between villages and bus timetables improves , public transport could be even better .
since we had a lot of success with this invention I started to have some fantas@@ ies of other high - tech portable inventions I could create .
I started imagining some type of synthetic tex@@ tile sla@@ sh fiber that when water touches the surface , it does n&apos;t get wet .
this could be really useful for the military because sometimes they have to work under the rain and their hands and body get wet and it &apos;s uncomfortable .
to do this I had to alter the gravity of the water when it touches the surface so instead of the material absorbing the water , it could have a reflection of it .
at first , when I applied the chemical into the material it became very rigid , thereby , it was uncomfortable to use and it had very little mobility .
I used a fraction less of that chemical to put it in the clothes to see the results of this minor change of volume on the secret substance I was using to make water have a reflection of a cloth for military and other various purposes like using it on a rainy day and replacing umbrellas , which could make a difference .
if this invention was able to work I could come come a lot of success and money to me . I suspended the cloth again to put the substance on it to see if this time this could work well . I could for@@ see that if my partners found out about my invention 2 things could happen : they would be proud of me to start creating and developing some new innovative ideas that could make big progress for humanity , or , they could get really mad at me because I did n&apos;t tell them about my project .

there &apos;s no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
when you travel by car you can have more privacy and you can go anywhere , anytime .
it &apos;s more expensive but has a lot of advantages .
public transport is good for the city , but personality is terrible . you need to wait and do n&apos;t have many directions to reach your address .
do n&apos;t have much comfort and sometimes you have to go without a seat .
many times , travel by bus is delayed and arrive crowd then waste time at all stop bus .
the people are different , and they are always different , no matter how much time passes , the people are different and they like that .
maybe the poor people have the possibility to buy a car as well . if it costs a lot of money for them , they will buy it .
it &apos;s a question of freedom and is a conqu@@ er@@ or of humanity .
no matter the improvements made to public transport , traveling by car was and will be the best choice for a future with more choices and not so rigid and compact , but flexible , fast and convenient .
my favourite sport is yoga . it is a fantastic sport .
I like yoga because it is a relaxing sport , when we can work our mind and our body .
yoga helps to have a greater flexibility and working your concentration .
yoga helps us to live relaxed and accept life with her is .
it allows you to work the organism by stretching techniques .
yoga has many benefits both emotional , spiritual and moral that we should learn to be better able to deal with the situations facing us on a daily basis .
the advice I would give someone starting this sport is relax and enjoy the maximum that yoga has to offer you .
according to Lun@@ de , 8@@ 5% of hom@@ icide victims are killed by someone they know .
yes , statistics from S@@ C do support this thesis .
these tragedies illustrate the power of frustration on the human body .
people who murder others probably did n&apos;t go into the situation wanting to murder the other .
the person &apos;s frustration led to anger and aggression that just got out of control .
even small things such as getting in the way of someone &apos;s goal can lead to frustration which leads to aggressive acts of murder .
these tragedies also illustrate the fli@@ pp@@ ancy with which we Americans view murder and other forms of violence .
through exposure , perhaps we have been des@@ en@@ si@@ tized to violence .
the media also plays a part in this fli@@ pp@@ ancy .
when a character is shot , he often appears in the next scene .
kids , in particular , are n&apos;t forming realistic <eos> as regarding violence .
the media also des@@ en@@ si@@ tiz@@ es men to sex crimes leading to more rap@@ es .
we as potential parents must in@@ still in our children - the future presidents , doctors , teachers , and even murders - a true picture of aggression and the need to control it .
racial prejudice is not as pronounced as it was 30 years ago .
it is actually appearing to decline .
this is evi@@ d@@ enced in , for example , cartoons and T.@@ V shows - racial minorities are not public@@ ly stereotyp@@ ed .
attitudes regarding des@@ e@@ <eos> have also changed - perhaps as a result of the psychology of inevitably and cognitive dis@@ son@@ ance .
perhaps through the media and other sources some mis@@ concep@@ tions are being cleared up and more realistic information is being provided to the public .
I would suggest that he either focus on the similarities of ideas and opinions with that person &apos;s or genuinely consider presenting his opinions and then converting to the others &apos; opinions .
he should also appear competent , but not perfect ( the pr@@ at@@ fall effect ) .
he could at first pretend to think negatively of her and then gradually evaluate her more positively ( gain - loss theory ) .
the client should appear as attractive as he can w / o using his attractiveness to manipulate her .
the client can hope ( particularly if he is of AV@@ G or lower attractiveness ) that she has a moderately low self - esteem and will thus be less selective in her choices for dates or friends .
the client should also disclose personal info .
to the client to induce her to like him .
this advice can be backed up w@@ / research .
it would be better for the client to ask a favor of the person - b / c from this cognitive dis@@ son@@ ance , the other would view the client as being generally more favorable .
in discussing sensitivity , the author emphasizes the importance of being sensitive to one &apos;s own feelings , thoughts , and the effects of his own behaviour on others .
only when this is accomplished can he become sensitive to others &apos; feelings .
sensitivity is a necessary component of effective communication .
confrontation can make one more sensitive to his own behavior and how others interpret it .
one should be sensitive to the others &apos; interpretation of his behavior so that he will know better how to act .
Micheal arrived home at 5@@ :@@ 45 pm .
he went straight into his room with a furious face .
he sat down on his bed , screaming .
after that , he began to smash his things .
his mother heard the noise and decided to see what was going on .
she took the stairs , and went into Micheal &apos;s room .
she saw things lying everywhere .
she asked him why he did it .
Micheal , instead of answering , shouted at her .
he and his mother had a cl@@ ash on something .
a while later , she left the room , leaving the door open .
at that moment , Micheal began to calm down .
he thought about what he had done and let out a sigh .
Micheal closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
genetic manipulation is an area which has caused a great deal of controversy within the sci@@ entic field with a number of advantages and disadvantages .
one of the main advantages is the ability to tail@@ or other organisms genetic makeup towards man &apos;s needs .
the possibilities are endless . a crop could be designed that would grow in the dry , hot conditions of many third world countries , relieving them of their worries of starvation .
cattle could be br@@ ed which are more efficient at converting plant energy to body mass or even diseas@@ ed could be killed off by altering people &apos;s resistance to them .
of course to some extent genetic manipulation already exists .
R@@ ace@@ horses are br@@ ed from certain combinations of parents and gar@@ den@@ ers cross breed plants to suit their individual needs .
however , there is much opposition to the process of genetic mutation .
the advantages seem very favourable and I &apos;m sure that a scientist would take much credit for these .
but would he accept the blame if he caused one of the many disadvantages of genetic manipulation ?
there are many possibilities for the misuse of this process .
one is a question of ethics and morals .
is it right to try and change motive ?
is it the right of one man to play God ?
it is also possible that we would not be able to control the new organisms that would be created by genetic engineering .
a new plant which has an increased grow@@ thr@@ ate may seem like an answer to all our problems but what would we do if suddenly it upset the ecosystem , dr@@ aining the soil of its nutrients and not allowing other plants to grow ?
in theory a scientist should take responsibility for this but in an area such as genetic manipulation of which we do not know a great deal , it may not be possible to find a solution .
another problem would be the process of testing .
we are already near the stage where it is possible to test people &apos;s genetic make up to find the possibility of their developing certain illness .
soon it may be possible for firms to only employ people with a certain expected lifespan or for insurance companies to refuse to in@@ sure certain individuals on the basis of a genetic test .
although the threat of the Cold War has dimini@@ shed , the technology made available from studies into genetic war@@ fare could be dangerous in the wrong hands - particularly in the area of ger@@ m war@@ fare .
although scientists can take credit for the developments and improvements in the quality of life which their research brings , there are so many disadvantages that they would be forced to take responsibility for the misuse of this new technology .
I &apos;m so sorry too late sending e - mail
it &apos;s nice to hear from you and read .
the month of March first days was terrible , because I had a cold then toothache for about 2 weeks .
now I had healed over .
we are fine .
I &apos;m doing my job and studying for a master &apos;s lesson .
my masters first semester , I have been studying which lessons Th@@ in film fabri@@ cations and applications , the@@ ori@@ tical physics , and dif@@ fraction methods . the@@ ori@@ tical physics is little bit boring .
and studying ram@@ an spec@@ tr@@ os@@ copy .
I am glad the weather will be warming the temperature -@@ 4 to + 2 degrees Celsius .
the problem is that there is not enough time to learn English .
it &apos;s bad .
I &apos;m confused but I know only one thing that must be study English .
it has been long discussed that people always learn big lesson from mistake .
some people think there is no room for mistakes in daily life , work even in their family .
however , I certainly consider Mi@@ stake to be truly a necessary step in our learning experience .
I am going to show a real story about Michael to testi@@ fy my viewpoint .
Michael was a six - year - old child who lived in the lovely countryside with his parents and his newborn little brother , Tom .
in this small countryside , Michael received all his parents &apos; love , attention and passion .
nonetheless , things went different until little Tom was born . Michael lost all his care suddenly .
he felt deeply despair and tried all his effort to get back concern that belongs to himself .
in a zoo in the south of France , millions of species live there .
this place is visited daily by many children and adults for the people that live in that country , and also in another country .
one day , some friends of the city that this zoo is , decided to stroll along the river , to have a picnic , to play football and have a good time together .
they were on holiday .
suddenly , while they were playing football and eating a sandwich each one of them , Max saw a little lion that wanted to attack and get all of their food . although it was tender to see this situation , Bob was a little scared .
Max was very fond of the animal , because he thought it was very small and very playful . otherwise , he and his three other friends would never have approached the animal .
it was dusk , in the warm summer of southern France . while they saw two men of security walking towards them from the great zoo of this city , we looked at each other and we said that the animal had escaped from the zoo .
finally , the starry sky and full night , and each one in your house .
he was very exhausted and sa@@ id@@ :@@ &quot;@@ What an amazing day ! &quot;
Max whispered to himself as he got into bed that night .
I &apos;m so glad to hear you are coming !
you have no idea how happy I am .

in connection with your question , I &apos;ll try to tell you how you can reach my house .
there are three possibilities .
firstly , you can take a taxi , but I have to warn you about taxi drivers .
they &apos;re s@@ ly boots and they could ask you to pay more than it really costs .
secondly , you can take the bus .
unfortunately , our buses are n&apos;t comfortable .
and the last alternative , and I recommend this one to you , is my car !
I &apos;ll wait to collect you at the airport and it wo n&apos;t cost you anything .
since you ask about the best places to visit , I &apos;d suggest visiting a few places , such as Oxford , London and Pic@@ ca@@ di@@ lly .
these places are really pul@@ chri@@ t@@ ud@@ inous !
I &apos;m sorry I wo n&apos;t be able to accompany you on your excursions , as I have not much free time and need to complete my assignments .
you &apos;re lucky because museums and galleries are not too far from my house .
you can go to one of the most famous museums in the UK , such as the British Museum .
I recommend seeing the galleries in the Royal Academic of Arts and the National Por@@ trait Gallery .
I &apos;m certain you will not be disappointed !
I had never felt so nervous before in my life because it was the first time for me being on stage and singing in front of such a big crowd .
how could I possibly know that some months after that day I would be performing for the president of our country for even more people ?
as I walked towards the stage in this hall , feeling every eye piercing me , there were several things running through my head .
I thought of losing consciousness , getting a heart attack or even worse : being shouted at by a bad singer by somebody from the audience .
at this point my knees started w@@ ob@@ bling and I felt as if I was going on pudding .
whenever I make a flash@@ back to these seconds , which felt like hours , I have no idea how I really managed to get on this stage but somehow I finally found myself standing there and in slow motion grabbing for the microphone with my hands shaking like an earthquake had just evo@@ ked .
the moment had come .
I in@@ hal@@ ed and could almost feel the air wid@@ ening my lungs .
I opened my mouth , tried to calm down and to bring all my concentration to the first note which ... did n&apos;t come .
well , it did but not noticeable for anybody .
so I tried again and suddenly my attitude changed from the mouse who was nervous like hell to the woman who loved singing and sharing it with the world .
the melody started to flow and I was happily filling the hall with the music .
like is it said on the top &quot; There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
&quot; , yes , I agree with that cuz &apos; now the people are getting tired of waiting for the bus or any public transport vehicle , now the personal car is the power , if you want to go ...
I do n&apos;t know ..... in a place like your hol@@ yday house , maybe a bus can not arrive there and you need a personal car .
if you want to move stuff from a place to different place , you ca n&apos;t do that by bus . you need a personal car , so personal care is better than a public transport vehicle .
the principal aim of this report is to provide the organisers of an international festival with information about the interests of young people in my country .
I am going to write about their interests in music , in the television programmes and in the clothes they are used to wearing , conclud@@ ing with my personal statement .
firstly , by conducting a survey among young people in my area , it emerged that music is essential for them .
in fact , youngsters are inspired by the songs they listen to and by the music videos as well .
for the same token , most of those surve@@ yed claimed that their favorite singer is also their idol .
secondly , young people expressed their interest in television programmes such as films and series .
series became so popular that numerous teenagers spend at least half of their afternoons watching series on their technology items , neglecting schoolwork and extracurricular activities .
moreover , sometimes young people get obsessed by TV series and they lose their social life as well .
lastly but not least , youngsters are interested in fashion .
in fact , almost every girl interviewed admitted that they are very keen on being fashionable , and a large number of them claimed that they love having a wide range of clothes in order to show how fancy they are .
in conclusion , I personally think that the next international festival should regard all of these young people &apos;s interests if the organisers want it to be a success .
in the picture I can see a boy walking two dogs on the seaside .
I think he &apos;s about 12 years old .
he is wearing a black &apos; n white jacket and black shorts .
he is Sho@@ eless .
one dog has got brown fur , it &apos;s breed is d@@ ach@@ sh@@ und .
the second dog is white and its breed is Mal@@ tese .
the boy is looking at the dogs at lea@@ shing them .
it seems that he is happy .
there are some rocks in the sea and on the beach , there is also a b@@ ough lying on the sand .
the weather does n&apos;t look very bad , but it &apos; s cloudy and I think it &apos;s not so hot there .
dear Jo ,
firstly , I would like to thank you for visiting my country .
I am sure that my country is the best option .
the reason why I say this is that it has plenty of wonderful landscape as well as career opportunities .
next , I am proud to tell you about the beauty of my country .
there are 54 minorities living soci@@ ably together in the &quot; s &quot; shape country .
every minority lands in every region which is different to the other .
my country has not only modern cities but also sp@@ aring villages that make you feel a lot of emotion .
in particular , I would have to say that cuisine is the thing which you should n&apos;t miss .
then , despite being a developing country , there are many opportunities to grow your career .
nowadays , Vietnam has been attracting foreign investments from many countries .
besides that dominate industry also is improving prom@@ in@@ ently , especially , export field .
we export mainly agriculture products , for instance rice , seasonal fruit and vegetable .
travel service occupies a large rate of GDP of my country with a lot of types of travelling .
finally , I am looking forward to seeing you in my country soon .
yours faithfully ,

a topic that I like so much is about electricity .
in today &apos;s world everybody uses electrical energy for almost all .
it is present in your personal computer , lamps and anything which you need to plug it in .
but almost no one knows that electricity travels a long way to get to your houses .
the journey starts in the plant of energy , where@@ in the electricity is generated by resources like water , wind , solar energy , nuclear energy and other methods .
then , electrical energy travels even the sub@@ station .
after this , electrical energy needs to lose a little bit of energy to arrive in your house without trouble and it occurs in a place called sub@@ station .
therefore , we need to think very well before we waste energy .
because it is an expensive cost for you and mainly for the environment .
essay
it is widely known that the majority of teenagers are keen on video games .
some people believe that it &apos;s a waste of time and a bad habit too , while some others think that it &apos;s a good way to spend your free time .
to my mind there are pros and cons .
first of all , computer games can help you to escape from your busy schedule and get some rest and relaxation after school .
apart from that , it is quite convenient mainly because you stay at home and have entertainment .
also , video games are more interesting than traditional toys , so they capture teenagers &apos; interest .
last but not least , some of them are educational and give you the ideal opportunity to gain knowledge .
on the other hand , there are many drawbacks .
to begin with , when you spend a lot of hours on the computer screen , you become addicted to them .
as a result , you do n&apos;t get together with your friends and you do n&apos;t communicate face to face .
in addiction , a lot of video games are full of violence and teens tend to imitate them so they have violent and aggressive behavior .
also , playing video games for hours is very harmful to your eyes .
in conclusion , computer games are a nice way to spend your free time but always in moder@@ ation .
I feel the invention of the computer has significantly changed people &apos;s lives .
this , reali@@ stically , has been quite a new invention , and in its short life span has been able to change the world significantly .
not to mention how it will change people &apos;s lifestyles in the future .
these changes , resulting from the invention of the computer , have been making me feel both bad and good .
technologically , computers have improved people &apos;s lives drastically .
no longer are the times when people must write a paper manually , or even with a simple type@@ writer .
personal computers are becoming quite common , and therefore less expensive and easier to own .
computers have also made life tran@@ sp@@ ire much quicker than before .
gone are the days when a person who wanted money from a bank had to wait until it was open .
we now have ATM , automatic teller machines that are able to proceed with the same transactions as a teller would do .
it seems these days EVERY@@ THING is run by computers !
we are able to complete our tasks much better and much more efficiently .
basically every fac@@ et of life has been affected by computers bringing about positive results .
while computers have brought about improvements , in my opinion , they also have &quot; im@@ person@@ alized &quot; the world .
jobs are being taken away from humans who are not &quot; fast enough &quot; .
interaction with humans in some places is extinct .
yes , it might be more efficient to have a computer make your transaction at a bank , but I miss the human interaction between people .
in addition , it is also very dangerous to place all of one &apos;s trust in a machine .
it is a common fact that machines do fail !
sure , a car with a computer that tells the driver when an on - coming ob@@ stical is approaching is safe , but what happens when the driver relies too much on the computer and not enough on their own brain ?
people soon stop thinking , and allow machines to do the work for them .
I feel afraid when our society relies so heavily on a bunch of wires .
computers are not able to express and truly feel emotions , and therefore are incapable , in some inst@@ ances , to function .
with the invention of the computer comes many changes from the lifestyle of the past to changes in the lifestyle of the future .
some of these changes will save people &apos;s lives , such as advances in medical technology , safety , etc .
but I fear that our world will become a very im@@ personal place .
I hope that we will be able to determine what improvements should be made and what should just remain &quot; slow &quot; .
dear Mrs Ashby ,
I am writing to apply for one of the positions helping in your cafe .
I saw an advertisement near my house for this job .
I have the right qualifications for this job . for instance , I have taken courses in cooking . hence , I am interested in all kinds of food .

I am very hard - working , enjoy working with other people and I would agree to work out how much you need .
I would like the opportunity to work in a cafe .
I am a sociable person and I like working with others .
in addition , this job would offer me more experience in my chosen professional field since I want to apply in future as a chef in a restaurant .
I am available for interview at any time .
I am looking forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience .
please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further information .
I can be contacted at 07@@ 4@@ 1@@ 6666@@ 6 at every hour .

Fl@@ or Bar@@ bus
I would like to recommend M@@ z@@ olis restaurant .
it is a place located in the heart of Warsaw .
a lot of foreigners go there to try delicious , traditional South African grilled food .
it is rather an informal restaurant , designed in a rustic style , which guarantees a really nice ambiance .
when it comes to food , you can try all kinds of grilled meat , even the most exotic one .
about the service , I can all it unusual as you choose your meat and the staff will prepare your dish , then you go to the kitchen to get your dish and eat it with your hands .
I have been there once and I really like that place . you feel at home and the food is delicious .
the price is also the cheapest I could find in this country .
the main reason why I like that place is because I could see many different people from different parts of the world .
I was there several times but I still would like to go there again with my classmates .
the best film
I am a fan club film , that is called high school musical fans .
high school musical is the best film I could see in the world .
when you see the thriller you can stop looking for it and immediately you want to see the film .
it &apos;s a move that all people could see .
I think I find it exciting because I love all films like them .
this great move is about a group of people that go to secondary school . this school is not like all schools , it &apos;s different , because you have a lot of activities , like basketball , theater , etc .
I think that people would like to see it because when you see it , you can stop it and you have a lot of music , songs and people dancing .
in my opinion it &apos;s the best film I saw in my life and if you have the opportunity to see it , do it .
the reason why fox hunting should be banned is because it is a cruel sport .
there are many people trying to stop the sport taking place .
the reason why people kill and hunt foxes is because they kill chickens and because they enjoy the social side of the sport .
at this present time , I am sure farmers can come up with some ideas to prevent the fox from getting at his chickens .
if they did this then there would not be a need for killing fox@@ s and going on hun@@ ts .
when hun@@ ts take place , other wildlife are harmed as well as the fox@@ s .
some homes of animals may be destroyed and some innocent animals may be harmed .
once the fox@@ s are caught it is said that they suffer a horrible death and if this continues it will be unfair .
many people have no problems with fox@@ s and the hunt should not be included as a sport , as it will not be fun to experience .
if fewer fox@@ s are killed it means that there will be fewer rabbits around to destroy the crops so this will be a benefit to a lot of farmers and this is not cruel , it is just the way of life .
fox hunting is a horrible sport as the fox is hun@@ ted down by a pack of dogs and men on horse@@ back .
the fox is then chased until it is caught .
thinking about this is very upsetting and most people would be relieved if fox hunting was banned .
Fox@@ s have as much right on this earth as we do and I am sure we can deal with the situation in a different way .
I am sure nobody will want to go through what a fox goes through on a hunt so I do not see why we should put fox@@ s through it .
if fox@@ s are unable to harm farm animals there is not a danger in banning the sport .
the reason why fox hunting should continue is to keep the amount of fox@@ s down and not cause a change in the food chain .
Fox@@ s are not needed to keep down the rabbit population as farmers are able to use pois@@ ons to kill off the rabbits .
if you ban fox hunting it means that the protest@@ ers will have won and this gives them the incentive to protest about something else .
a few people enjoy the sport and allow them to socialize .
I myself believe that fox hunting should be banned as it is very cruel .
another reason why it should not be banned is because foxes give chickens a cruel death when they kill them .
if they decide they have to continue the sport because they need to kill foxes , the sport should be banned and a more reasonable death should be considered .
report
this report will deal with whether cars should be banned from the centres of all major cities or not .
the number of cars has increased in countries in the last decade .
too many cars running around people can be a serious problem to deal with .
but what should we do to make it up ?
there are some pros and cons .
pros
first , there would be less noise in the streets .
in particular in Spain , where city centres are usually quite narrow .
second , there would be less air pollution .
it is proved that too much smog in the atmosphere is harmful to the health .
third , cities would be friend@@ lier to live in .
places where people could enjoy walking around .
cons
first , local sellers &apos; work could be damaged in that area because they could need to upload and download goods for the shops .
second , people who live in that part of the city could be affected in a negative way because they would need to pass through it with some cars so as to get home .
in my opinion it would be a good idea to do it but we would need to balance different interests in order to do it right .
there is an opinion that computers will be used instead of books in the future .
I believe that it is true , because computers are more convenient and easier to use .
tablets are light and you can give only one without caring about many heavy books .
and it is common knowledge that gadgets make our life easier .
but some people have other opinions about it .
firstly , studying at school has become simple . students can find a lot of different information about something interesting .
I do n&apos;t know where to start .
I &apos;m only going to bare my heart to my computer .
because I feel lonely myself .
and I do n&apos;t know what I need exactly , and I do n&apos;t know what I should do definitely .
but I understand for sure I need some changes in my life .
I wish some really pleasant and enjoyable events burst into my life .
it must happen I &apos;m sure .
the question is how long do I have to wait yet .
my patience is already ending .
I refuse to understand and accept the fact that I ca n&apos;t afford myself luxurious life .
yes , I was always dreaming about wealth .
I am not a greedy av@@ ar@@ ic@@ ous person .
I only want my wishes fulfilled .
I have not so many desires in my mind .
I only wish my favourite and loved ones are healthy and wealthy and happy .
I wish I , my daughters and my husband , were travelling a lot . we love each other and we have enough money for everything we want .
the Sing@@ le European Act , signed in February 1986 by the He@@ ads of Government of the 12 Member States of the European Community and which came into force on 1st July , 1987 aims to create a single market by the end of the year 1992 .
this major target is to be attained by the removal of all fiscal , technical and physical barriers .
this means that a merchant or tr@@ ad@@ es@@ man would be able to sell his goods in any community country , an individual would be able to borrow and deposit money in the banks of any member state and also work in any member state with national qualifications .
there would also be the introduction of a European passport and an integrated transport system .
despite the fact that the proposals put forward to amend the Tre@@ aty of Rome came from an Englishman , namely Lord Co@@ field , there has been widespread dissatisfaction in Britain regarding the single market , shown by frequent discussions in Parliament and letters to leading national newspapers , whereas J@@ acqu@@ es Del@@ ors , the president of the European Commission described the measures adopted as a mere compromise .
in accordance with the Constitu@@ tional Law of Britain , Parliament is the supreme law - making body in the United Kingdom .
consequently the emergence of another source of law , deemed to be su@@ pr@@ a - national , is inevitably a problem .
one of the pr@@ ero@@ gative powers confer@@ red upon Parliament is the right to make tre@@ a@@ ties .
however these tre@@ a@@ ties are not directly effective on British individuals , so that where a treaty contains provisions giving rights and duties to an individual , he can not place reliance upon the treaty until it is substantially incorporated into the law of the United Kingdom , by an Act of Parliament .
this acts as a curb to the enforcement of European Community Law , so that to a certain extent , a degree of sovereignty is re@@ tain@@ ed .
yet , this is not as advantageous as it may at first appear , for there exists a general judi@@ cial presum@@ ption that Parliament does not intend to legi@@ sl@@ ate contrary to European Community Law .
personally , I think that although the integration of Britain into Europe will be beneficial in so many matters such as freedom of transportation , movement , work and many other real@@ ms , there are also many disadvantages in store , including the loss of sovereignty to a certain extent .
although the British Parliament will continue to regulate the acts or om@@ is@@ sions of individuals on a personal basis , for example in Criminal Law , its freedom to legi@@ sl@@ ate in the domain of public law will be severely restricted .
not only will Parliament be obliged to enforce Community Law , but also any later stat@@ utes passed by the British Parliament will either be con@@ stru@@ ed in the light of Community provisions or declared inv@@ al@@ id .
to conclude , it is feasible to imply that the sovereignty of Britain will be impaired in many ways , although only within the sphere of Community Law prevailing over national law .
in other senses , the sovereignty of Britain will be safe@@ guar@@ ded because Parliament will still reign supreme within the United Kingdom .
the turn of the century has brought with it many changes that have greatly altered lives throughout the globe .
each decade in itself has introduced a new &quot; f@@ ad &quot; or discovery that has been fixed in our minds as &quot; typical &quot; of the era .
the &quot; Ro@@ aring 20 &apos;s &quot; for example was marked by fl@@ apper skirts and the invention of the automobile .
a very cap@@ ri@@ cious decade , it can be contra@@ sted with the years of hunger and unemployment that marked the &quot; Great De@@ pression &quot; of the 30 &apos;s .
how could we ever forget the &quot; Fa@@ bulous fif@@ ties &quot; or the hip@@ pie decade of the 60 &apos;s and 70 &apos;s ?
for change is inevitable , and as difficult as it may be to pin@@ point any one accomplishment that has taken place over the last 100 years as the most remarkable of the decade , there is one aspect of the 20th Century that will remain with me forever .
so as we embar@@ k on the year 2000 , I think it is only fair to call the 20th Century , &quot; The Century of Demo@@ cracy . &quot;
perhaps , it is because today is November 4th , the day after the U.S. elections .
perhaps , it is because the former super@@ power of the Soviet Union is now making its transition into a democracy .
perhaps it is because I am thousands of miles from my home , but I &apos;m feeling very patriotic these days .
no , I &apos;m not eng@@ ul@@ fed in the typical eth@@ no@@ centric ide@@ alism of a citizen from the United States .
rather , I &apos;m feeling patriotic because I can look around the world today and see that it is becoming a better place to live for people of all nations .
in the past 2 years alone , we have seen people all over the world finally take a stand for what they believe .
not too long ago , I remember the democratic demonstrations that caused the people of East and West Germany to unite as one democratic super@@ power .
at the World Expo in Sevilla , not a month ago , I bought a ch@@ unk of what was once the Berlin Wall@@ - the Wall that was a symbol to many of the harsh realities of the Cold War .
that wall is gone forever and I feel lucky to be among the many who could follow its happening .
the Soviet Union , as well , is going through its own transition to democracy .
the many unhappy people of this troubled nation finally took it upon themselves to rid their nation of its communist government .
the super@@ power among super@@ powers that to me had long been the example of Mar@@ x@@ ism is now following in the footsteps of the rest of the world .
with the end of the Cold War , there has been more peaceful relations throughout the world .
the idea of a nuclear war is practically non - exi@@ stent today .
arms sales have gone down so that nations may spend this money in more worthwhile areas .
in conclusion , as the turn of the century slowly approaches , I look back with a feeling of accomplishment as well as anticipation as to what lies ahead .
as a world of many scattered nations , conflict is inevitable .
however , if we all have one bon@@ d@@ - demo@@ <eos> y@@ - then maybe together , we can learn to understand one another , and work towards a happier world for all .
it is a well - known fact that everybody needs holidays .
to begin with this topic we need to ask ourselves about several matters to have in mind .
firstly , we must be aware of our economic situation , the season where we are , the people who come with us , the transport , the accommodation , the place .. and more matters that we should note when we decide to go on holiday .
secondly , we should consider two main options : going abroad or around our home ? .
this could be the first question that we wonder before going on holiday .
nowadays , due to the globalization and the increased number of flights around the world , we can find a wide range of websites where the flight companies offer their services at incredible low prices .
because of these low prices , many people decide to go abroad instead of travelling near their home .
of course , in order to prepare a good trip you also must consider the accommodation , the food , etc and depending on the place you choose , you will spend more money or less .
another point to consider should be the environment . if you go abroad , you can visit the know@@ nest typical monuments and historical natural places around the world and if you stay in your country , despite the fact that you can see a lot of places , the things you see are limited .
in conclusion , I think one person must consider several points when you plan a holiday trip and it depends on the person &apos;s knowledge about where to go and how , what to determine if one trip could be cheaper or expensive .
dear Sir ,
my name is Tom@@ as Gar@@ c@@ ía and I am writing regarding the advertisement which appeared in the newspaper yesterday , about the summer camps &apos; job .
I am 25 years old and come from Spain .
my mother tongue is Spanish but I can speak English fluently too .
besides , as you can see from my enclosed CV , I studied for a Law Degree and worked for companies such as ..... and .... , in very similar jobs to what you are offering .
that is why I consider that my experience and qualifications fit very well with this position &apos;s requirements .
moreover I would especially like to point out that I have always been interested in working with people , especially taking care of little children and helping them to be happy .
for all these reasons , I consider I am a very suitable candidate for this position and I would appreciate the opportunity to come in for an interview and talk with you further about this vacancy .
my contacting data is in the attached c@@ v , at your convenience .
I look forward to hearing from you .
yours Sincerely .
the European Community is the grou@@ ping of 12 sovere@@ ign European States whose intention is to develop closer economic and political cooperation .
it &apos;s intention is to encourage greater freedom of movement of goods and also services , capital and the workforce .
the competition for trade is in modern times so great that Britain has no choice but to join Europe in order to increase the market for its goods .
Britain has been recognised as having a particular skill in the areas of banking and insurance .
the European market will give us the opportunity to use this skill in a far wider market .
the creation of one European commercial market will also benefit the consumer since a hom@@ og@@ eni@@ sation of standards is also in the process of being introduced , hopefully to the highest common den@@ om@@ in@@ ator .
the European does not serve only as a useful trade association , however , environmental problems can be tack@@ led more effectively if the European community confron@@ ts such problems together .
Co - operation between the community police forces will assist in overcoming the problems of drug smu@@ ggling and terrorism .
the common defence policy of such a large area of Europe would also be beneficial and possibly less costly if the member states poo@@ led their resources .
however some loss of national sovereignty will inevitably occur .
the single European Act was designed to speed - up the decision making of certain institutions .
the act meant that member governments had to be committed to greatest co - operation and joint action in the areas of foreign , social and environmental policy , thus leaving less room for differences of opinion among the members .
the decisions of the European Court of Justice already take preced@@ ence over national law , which can be seen as a major infringement of our national sovereignty .
more participation in the election of members of the European Parliament would help to elect those strongest to promote British interests in Europe .
the question is how much sovereignty Britain is prepared to lose and do the benefits of belong@@ inging to a single Europe outweigh the disadvantages .
a certain loss of sovereignty has already been felt and in the next few years this will increase .
as far as the immediate future is concerned , a certain loss of sovereignty is the price we have to pay for material progress .
in most of the earlier studies , the effect of either ocean ac@@ idi@@ fication or warming has been investigated at a time .
however , in nature these stres@@ sors affect the organism comb@@ ine@@ dly and the effect could be more than the effect of a single stres@@ sor .
I remember the old people how they did with their children .
they were all poor , they did n&apos;t have enough money to pay for their children &apos;s education .
all the children should have to help their parents .
some of them have been adopted by other parents .
the children wanted to learn education but they do n&apos;t have enough money to pay .
some of the children were working in the sugar cane field or they worked in a shop to receive money to feed themselves and have many good people who were in a good manner .
nowadays many people have changed their lifestyle .
and their life has become bird in the sky .
some of them have already achieved their life .
they have plenty of money and their children have all that they want and some children are very bad manners .
they do n&apos;t respect their parents and they do not wonder what they did .
some of them have already given birth to a child at the age of sixteen or married .
the world has already changed now .
they have good doctors who are qualified and great skill .
many people developed their own country .
for example , they want to attract more and more tourists in their country .
some of the children who at the age of eighteen have already left their home to live along with their girlfriend .
they did not remember what their parents had done for them .
people have changed the style of their life ..
some boys like to give new hairstyles .
just like girls , they like to put many accessories with them like makeup .
they want to give a new fashion to make a number for themselves .
people have become more skilled and also in a bad way .
in the next 50 years , people can create many electronic things like cars and machines like televisions .
television has brought many advantages which would never be en@@ vis@@ aged by our great grandparents .
people will develop more model television .
year by year the world will change and become more developed .
long ago , the early cars had wooden bodies which made them extremely vulnerable in the event of a crash .
for about 30 years , cars have switched to all steel bodies .
today cars are stronger , lighter and safer than earlier designs .
it means that today people create more new features .
television is an interesting source of information . people see it every day . you have one comedy program about quantum physics . television is a study object . if you propose that , it is only a more tool in your investigation .
if you arrive in the morning , you have TV news . in the news you have a good rating . all the people need to have the information about the world day after day .
if you enter in the afternoon , you have kids or young people , but the really have an interest in this proposal is , that all people want to see the soap operas in these hours and want to see comedies or interesting documentaries about whatever we want .
Hi Ana ,
yes , I am in progress with learning English right now .
by coincidence I work in IT sphere now , therefore I need this language in my daily communication with customers .
please feel free to contact me in case of any questions .
thanks ,
Alex
I do n&apos;t agree .
I think the future is public transport .
also , I think this applies to many things .
now we live in a shared world , where everything is shared : work , development , ideas , many things .
this is a new philosophy .
the basis of this philosophy is &quot; to share &quot; .
this idea brings great benefits for all .
is the same case for transport ?
if we shared transport ( public transport ) could be lower , cars would have less pollution and less traffic .
everybody saves money and the familiar economy is better .
the cities have become more ag@@ ile and it is easier to get to places .
this model has many advantages .
to solve the problem of the traditional model , because then the traffic is worse and the time for both kinds of transport can grow and be horrible . it &apos;s more comfortable and quicker to move on personal transport , but if only one mode of transport , this will be more efficient and more comfortable for all of us .
I think the whole world would benefit : environment , people , family , work .. so on
I agree with this statement . I think the future will be like everyone will have their own car and they wo n&apos;t use public transport .
nowadays , every person wants to live conveniently for himself .
so they just buy a new car for themselves .
but some people ca n&apos;t buy it .
because they haven&apos;t got enough money and they have material problems .
so they account for using public transport .
there is untouchable to poor people .
in my opinion , using public transport will not be so popular than travelling by car .
in my opinion , public transport has a long future because a lot of people live in big cities and they do n&apos;t use the car to get around the city , because public transport is more comfortable , so they can take the bus and next take the underground and finally arrive at any place that they want .
but if they use the car , probably the world will be late for the place that they go .
I think if people use public transport there is less pollution and the sky in the city should be blue instead of grey so anybody should n&apos;t say that public transport does n&apos;t have a future .
moreover , a lot of people use public transport because it does n&apos;t have a car .
in conclusion , nowadays , people are very conscious about the environment , which could be produced by cars , and they do n&apos;t use the car a lot , so I think that is n&apos;t the end for public transport .
today we see a lot of television . I think that it is not a great result . due to watching more television , you can become lazy .
in addition , most of these programs are stupid , good only to spare your time .
the reason is that a lot of people do n&apos;t want to receive bad news , but they only love to be entertainment .
fortunately , not all TV channels have these programs .
there is somebody that tries to invent new programs trying to educate people .
one of these is Channel 5.@@ During the day , they transmit some interesting programs about history and nature .
I strongly believe that it &apos;s possible to do both of the programs .
for example , during the days it &apos;s possible to mix sending news , quiz programs , but also documentaries and interviews .
if we have channel programs like these , I am sure that all Italian citizens could have a good benefit and more knowledge about our beautiful world .
dear Alison
how are you doing ? I am writing to you just to let you know about the eating habits and customs in my country .
in Argentina , the most typical foods are em@@ pan@@ adas , mate and dul@@ ce de le@@ che .
I am hundred percent sure that everyone in this country has already tried em@@ pan@@ adas at least once .
we usually have breakfast as soon as we wake up .
most people usually drink chocolate milk and eat biscuits at breakfast .
we also have a tea time and we eat similar things in the morning . I know for you it will sound kind of weird ! we have lunch at twelve o&apos;clock and dinner around ten .
what really makes a traditional Sunday in Argentina is the food , most common the barbecue , with the whole family .
it is a custom that I hope I will never lose it@@ !@@ .@@ You should come to visit me and experience it by yourself . I am sure you will love it !
I hope my letter has helped you !
best wishes

lots of people believe that sooner or later public transport will lose its important role .
first of all , due to the fact that travelling by car is much more convenient .
actually , you can use your vehicle not only to get to the office or to reach the shopping mall , but even to go on holiday without having to stand in a queue before catching a train , a plane or a bus .
actually , there are lots of traffic jams , and it is quite common to be stacked along the road .
but it could be quite the same for travelling by bus and other means of transport .
secondly , cars are becoming cheaper day after day , so everyone can afford to buy one , even those who are not considered wealthy people .
so far , public transport has been considered relatively cheap , environmentally correct and fast .
on the one hand , we can not forget that cars have a bad impact on the quality of air and that they are one of the most important causes of pollution .
on the other hand , everyone is more or less aware that airline companies have surely a great impact on air pollution .
anyway , it could be possible to travel by car and when you arrive at a certain destination , you can choose to cycle or to walk instead of catching buses , trains , the underground or other public means of transport .
cycling or walking could be even better than public transport : much more healthy , cheaper and faster .
we must even take into consideration the fact that the car industry has developed lots of new vehicles .
there are now available new models , for example electric cars , that are environmentally - friendly ; they are not so expan@@ sive so everyone can buy one of them .
in conclusion , I strongly believe that there is no future for public transport and that travelling by car will be day by day faster , cheaper and even environmentally less dangerous .
I think doing sports is healthy .
when we do sport , we feel better , our body and our mind are good .
my favourite sport is yoga .
I go to the gym three times a week .
I love it , because when the class finishes , I feel well .
I sometimes take a walk in the forest .
I made the Santiago way 10 years ago .
I like it very much .
I walked 7@@ 60 km .
I started in Ron@@ ces@@ v@@ all@@ es and I finished in Santiago de Com@@ post@@ ela .
this way is so beautiful .
I met a lot of people from other countries , such as Brazil , Germany , Australia and so on .
a car might be more comfortable but still more risky than a train or bus .
I prefer to use my private car because of the long distance between my home and the location of my company .
Michael was just sitting there , wondering what should come next in his life .
time passed away , while the answers still did not show up to him , that was the moment he decided to make things happen .
he took a bag filled with clothes and snacks . no matter what , this will become the adventure of his life , a new beginning .
he walked outside his home and took the very first cab he saw . &quot;
nowhere &quot; was written in black bold letters on a sign in the front window of that cab .
he started wondering about the infinite choices he had ahead . &quot;
just take me to a bar &quot; - he thought to himself , but no , that was too simple . &quot;
take me to the airport &quot; - repeated in his mind , but no , that is too crazy .
&quot; just drive , I do n&apos;t matter where &quot; - he said to the taxi driver , whispering to his feet &quot; maybe I should not run away &quot; .
he felt the guilt of leaving . in the very second , he grabbed the cab door .
it was because of her wife ?
no .
it was because of her daughter ?
no .
it was because of his poor - paying job ?
no .
it was because he did not take the courage before , before it was selfish , before it was incorrect .
but the question surrounding his mind was : &quot; does that really matter ? &quot; .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
it is true that travelling by car is much more convenient than travelling by public transport .
but at the same time , it also consumes much more energy than travelling by public transport .
rather than saying there is no future for public transport .
I think it is more correct to say that there &apos;s no future for individual auto transport .
due to global warming , many countries including Taiwan , Turkey and Germany have been starting to promote public transport in order to protect our environment .
their government tries to increase oil prices and decrease public transport prices .
although the government tries to make us use public transport more .
I think there &apos;s still limited impact on our society .
the most efficient way is to promote it by ourselves .
if we all start to use public transport and tell people how good it is for our planet ,
I guess more people will start to do it .
social networks
if you want to talk with your friends , to share photos or to post anything you want , you have so many opportunities to do that : the social sites .
nowadays , people use the Internet to do anything - from taking information to sharing photos , uploading videos and other useful things .
so , the social networks are very extended now on the internet .
the most popular social networks are Facebook , Twitter , Yahoo , Fli@@ ckr , WhatsApp , Tum@@ blr , A@@ sk@@ .@@ fm a@@ .s@@ .@@ o .
let &apos;s take Facebook as an example .
Facebook is the biggest and the most used social network .
it has more than 1 billion users .
you can use a Facebook account for texting your friends , keeping in touch with them , sharing your own experiences , receiving noti@@ fications , uploading photos and videos and , of course , seeing what your friends post .
you can also see what &apos;s their opinion and what &apos;s new in politics , business and entertainment .
you can promote your own business , so your products and services can find their target easier .
Facebook has a lot of benefits , but at the same time , it can be very dangerous !
on the internet there are so many people who pretend they are someone else .
now , let me tell you my &quot; Facebook story &quot; .
when I was 11 years old , I had my first Facebook account .
I was so excited about it !
I felt like I had just discovered the technology .
I started to post photos with me , to share videos , to update status and meet new people .
then , I was thinking that it &apos;s &quot; cooler &quot; to write on Facebook that I live in Netherlands and work at Jack Daniel &apos;s .
I remember that I used to answer everybody , no matter who they were .
I talked with Romanian , Indian English , Arabian people and other strangers .
I did n&apos;t realise I was in danger .
two years later , when I was 13 years old , I started to realise that my old photos , videos and status were completely stupid and I decided to delete them all !
I have also changed my workplace and my country and I deleted the unknown people in my &quot; friends list &quot; , but I made a really big mistake : I made my phone number public !
one week later , after making my phone number public , I was called by a lot of strangers and some of them were using the private number .
I really did n&apos;t like it !
now , I &apos;m 15 years old and I think I &apos;m mature enough to use Facebook . I learned a lot from the big mistakes I made on Facebook until now .
I do n&apos;t accept friend requests from people I do n&apos;t know , I do n&apos;t talk to strangers , I do n&apos;t give my personal dates ( especially my phone number ) and I think twice before posting something .
I &apos;m thinking now : what was in my brain when I was talking with strangers ?
Oh my God , I was in a really big danger !
so , I want to give you some advice : do n&apos;t let your kids access Facebook if they are less than 13 years old because they can be very naive and the p@@ sh@@ y@@ cho@@ s , rap@@ ists a@@ .s@@ .@@ o are everywhere on the Internet .
in my opinion , social networks can be useful if you know how to use them , as long as you do n&apos;t let them control you .
I have a dream .
it seems big or not , I do n&apos;t know .
but I really want to make it come true .
my dream origin@@ ates in Messi . I do n&apos;t know how but Messi is my inspiration , maybe
he gave me a dream to go aboard .
then I will meet him .
y@@ ess .
he is also my motive .
young people tasting : health and fitness
nowadays , there &apos;s a great deal of information available both on the Internet and on T.@@ V. about how we need to be fit and why it &apos;s so important to keep healthy .
however , are young people aware of these facts ?
I think most of them do n&apos;t pay enough attention to their health and fitness since they spend a lot of time drinking alcohol and smoking .
instead of going to the gym , they behave badly at the weekend when they go clubbing , for example .
on the other hand , I consider that there are large number of young people who have fun without drugs and alcohol .
they also go to the gym , play sports and they are on a healthy diet .
in my opinion , you need to be fit to keep healthy .
you should be on a diet and do exercise .
if you do that , your body acts better than you expected .
our lifestyle regrettably follows going to the gym to get fit but going out to drink alcohol too .
both are impossible .

Wawel - Man@@ aging Center of old capital city
Wawel was once one of the most important places in Central Europe by most interval of time in the middle@@ age .
there was living and leading the brav@@ est Polish King and leaders in time , when Poland was once of the strongest countries in the World and the strongest in central Europe .
recent Wawel is place number one in Kra@@ k@@ ó@@ w for visitors because apart from brave history there we can find nice monuments , works of art and obviously we can get a lot of interesting information on tour with guide .
apart from tourism , history of Wawel is being created in recent years - there we can visit c@@ ement@@ ary , where the most famous leaders of Poland , like Jan III So@@ bi@@ es@@ ki , J@@ ó@@ z@@ ef Pi@@ ł@@ su@@ d@@ ki or Le@@ ch K@@ cz@@ y@@ ń@@ ski , who was President of Poland in recent years .
in Con@@ cl@@ usion , Wawel is a place worth visiting if you are planning to visit south Poland . the revit@@ alisation of Kra@@ k@@ ó@@ w city is also beauti@@ full , so everything matches a good whole .
people who are planing to see Wawel should n&apos;t forget about rest interesting places around Wawel , like Su@@ ki@@ en@@ nice , Smo@@ k W@@ aw@@ el@@ ski and many wonder@@ full temples - everything is not further than several hundred meters from Wawel .
dear J@@ en ,
last week , I went on an educational trip together with some students in the same class along with my class adviser .
we visited the National Museum .
it was nice to see the old reli@@ cs that were preserved for a long time . preserving those reli@@ cs that are being used today for us to learn what happened in the past .
after the trip , we took our lunch in a nearby food chain .
we enjoyed discussing the trip .
it was the day before yesterday , but Michael did not know this yet .
he just knew that he had to get to work on the novel , he so desperately wanted to finish , but had not managed to complete a single chapter so far .
he placed himself in front of the o@@ ak desk , opened his silver laptop and stared at the white , blank page of the document in front of him .
he did not know what to write , even though he knew the story , the characters , the plot , the twists at the end .
he knew the complexity , essence , feel , and every last detail of what he wanted to write .
suddenly , he felt his mind running in circles , spir@@ alling into the unknown , his fingers bla@@ zing over the keyboard faster than he had ever done it before , and the words assembled , gathered , became sentences , structured organisations of se@@ man@@ tic meaning , and suddenly , the chapter was finished .
he had no doubt that the inspiration came from above .
he closed the writing program and when asked whether or not to save the changes , he pressed &quot; Do n&apos;t Save &quot; as he always did after not writing anything , and then put on his jacket to go for a walk to celebrate .
he went out the door , and turned on his heel , looking in at his computer with a strange sensation in his stomach .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Hello , my name is Rol@@ le .

I think my favorite place is Tig@@ er@@ bal@@ sam@@ hall@@ en . there I play hockey because I love to play hockey .
three words that describe me can be happy , hockey and friends .

kebab is my favorite food .
my favorite restaurant is Nic@@ os pizz@@ eria because they have the best kebab .

dear Sir ,
I am writing with regard to your request about recommending some place to visit for your students .
to be honest , four hours is not much when it comes to sightseeing in my city and I have been thinking about it a lot , but in the end I think I may have got a perfect idea .
I do not know if you heard about our old castle .
it &apos;s in the very centre of the town , so it is very close to the hostel you are staying in .
we can visit it . it is open from eight till twelve ( I checked it ) . they have wonderful exhibitions there - paintings , sculptures , something from history and a little bit more modern as well .
the best part is , at 1 p.m. there is going to be a concert .
my friends from a school of music will be playing old instruments as a accomp@@ ani@@ ament to the sli@@ de@@ show of old photographs from 19th century .
I think the best would be if we go together at ten in the morning , see some paintings for two hours , then go for ice cream or pizza , or whatever kids would like to have during the break , and then go back to the castle for the show .
later we can do whatever you would like to do .
if you have any questions , just write or call me on my cellphone - 123 45@@ 6 .
yours faithfully ,
S@@ ev@@ as@@ tian Du@@ ź@@ ni@@ ak
when I started to think about my favourite sport , it was quite difficult for me to decide since I &apos;m very keen on sport practising .
as long as I can remember back in time , I &apos;ve always been engaged in sports .
nevertheless , if I had to choose one among all of them , running could be considered my favourite one .
running is one of the cheapest and easiest sports to do anywhere and at any time .
the only thing you need to do is just feel like spending half an hour breathing fresh air and relaxing .
an issue which is becoming increasingly debated is whether or not fox hunting should be banned .
in today &apos;s society , it is an outdated and bar@@ bar@@ ic &quot; sport &quot; which , in my opinion , should be banned .
in this country animal rights have been debated in par@@ li@@ ment and many measures have been implemented to safeguard animals welfare .
recently the British government has brought in legislation with respect to how animals , which are going to be sl@@ augh@@ tered , should be transported .
these measures include the time the animals spend on the road , how much room they have etc .
etc .
however , it is still perfectly legal for a group of people to chase a fox with a pack of dogs and watch them chase the fox until it is exhausted and then get torn apart by the dogs .
this , appar@@ antly , is a sport .
the Government has made it illegal for dogs to attack bad@@ gers whilst it is still legal for dogs to attack foxes .
surely this is unfair and hypo@@ critical of the government .
it is also illegal for two dogs to attack each other for the enjoyment of the spectators .
at least if one dog fights another the fight is , in some cases , fair .
but it is still perfectly legal for an infinite number of dogs to attack a single fox for the enjoyment of others .
the fox stands no chance , why is fox hunting legal whereas all other blood sports are banned .
fox hunting is , for the most part , enjoyed by the upper - class .
it is expensive to par@@ take in as you need a horse , dogs and riding equipment ( eg .
helmet , boots etc . )
you also need land to do it in .
it is my opinion that the conservative government will not ban fox - hunting because it will loose the support and funding from its upper class , wealthy supporters who fox hunt .
in a time when Britain has very few surviving wild animals , surely something should be done to protect the fox .
the British government is always among the first countries to support the protection of wild animals in other countries ( eg . when banning whaling ) and they are very ready to attack countries who do kill wild animals ( eg . the destruction of habitats in the Braz@@ il@@ lian rain forests ) .
but when it comes to c@@ easing the hunting and brutal killing of one of Britain &apos;s few natural animals , they seem to turn a blind eye .
according to people who par@@ take in fox hunting , it is an enjoyable sport .
a sport is when two evenly matched teams or individuals par@@ take in a game for enjoyment or a prize .
it could be gr@@ os@@ s@@ ly unfair to match one footballer against a team of eleven as the result would be a fore@@ gone conclusion .
if one boxer had to fight ten box@@ ers this would be unfair .
but matching one fox against a pack of dogs in a fight to death is still considered a sport .
cricket is a sport where brutal chase and killing of a fi@@ end for the enjoyment of the upper - class is not .
famous people , such as politicians and film stars and other celebrities , are ordinary people , as we are .
people always ido@@ li@@ se them and think that they are unusual , but they simply have extraordinary careers .
first of all , everybody deserves to have their private life without journalists , even though he or she lives in the li@@ me@@ light .
they should be able to spend their time with children , families , friends etc . to go on holidays , to celebrate something .
on the other hand , I think that it &apos;s impossible that these kinds of people have private lives , because fans and society want to know everything about them , about their private life .
they want to be in touch with their idols , to contact and to meet them in reality .
to sum up , if we are famous people we should bear in mind that fans will admire us , and journalists will come over to us , take photos of us and print them in gossip magazines or tabloids ( all that to the needs of the fans ) .
stars should realise that they are at the centre of attention .
in addition , they should choose what is more important to them - career or private life .
dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to you in order to apply for the summer camp job .
I &apos;m a student who is 20 years old and who loves taking care of children .
for me , this would be an incredible experience to improve my skills in helping with the organisation and cooking food .
I am a girl full of energy and always keeping a smile on my face .
I think I am a great candidate for your job ; If you need some further information , please do not hesitate to contact me .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
best wishes , Andrea .
when the time arrived for Lucy to make the transition from being a teenager to an adult , all her self - assurance and determination vanished in the thin air .
she had been a brilliant student at high school and intended to keep on being it .
she expected to work and study , all at the same time .
she had big plans but sometimes you have to slow down to achieve them .
she was going to study journalism and to do some part - time job in the meantime .
and she went for it : she started her career working as a cashier in a market but by the end of the month reality hit her in her face .
she started to be exhausted and her performance at university was deficient .
she needed to stop working or studying because her health was at risk ; she fell asleep in class and work , her diet was poor and her temper was disgusting .
she could only understand how disastrous her life was when she got to the limit .
even though nobody pushed her to , she was taking too many responsibilities that she was n&apos;t able to accomplish .
&apos; why are you running when you &apos;re just learning to walk ? &apos;
one of her friends told her once .
&apos; I want to make my future and I do n&apos;t want to waste time , &apos; she re@@ tor@@ ted , but was she happy ?
since then , she started to ask herself a lot of questions and doubts were her faithful companions .
during the week of exams she suffered from her first panic attack .
that was the sign that it was definitely the time for a change .
a friend of hers took her to a therapist and after a few sessions she began to catch a glimpse of what was all about .
&apos; success is not final , failure is not fatal : it is the courage to continue what counts . &apos;
said her therapist
there was the clue finally .
she would have to work on that all her life , though .
her biggest challenge was learning to accept her limits , but she would soon understand that life is about growing every day so she &apos;d have to enjoy the way and give her best over and over again .

how important is it for you to read books in English ?
in my opin@@ i@@ ón is important because it improves my vocabulary and helps me to express ideas easily .
could you tell me if you have reading habits to learn English ?
I do n&apos;t have reading habits to learn English . in my opinion , it is a custom that I had to have learned when I was a child because I would have grown up with reading as a hobby rather than as a duty .
do you think that it is difficult for you to create the habit of reading to learn English ?
I think that is difficult for me to create reading habits because I do n&apos;t like it but I think it is possible if I practise it .
most infant educators , psychologists and professionals of the education world think that using story@@ telling in early childhood education is good for their development .
but … is it that good ?
does story@@ telling have any disadvantages ?
using story@@ telling is a good way to work on values and their emotions , as they are too young to express them by themselves .
they see themselves in the main character , and through his experience they can learn how to act in these situations .
for instance , if the story is about fear ( emotion which makes them feel insecure ) and ends up in a good way , they will have different methods to overcome their fear and feel more secure and self - confident .
furthermore , they can take part and build up their own stories .
their vocabulary will increase at the same time as they are working on their soci@@ ability abilities .
in addition , they can see that every act has consequences . they have to be responsible .
however , there are some points that need to be considered .
story@@ telling must be chosen according to the age of the pupils .
one of the reasons story@@ telling may not work is because some teachers expect more than their pupils can do .
moreover , if the story is too long or dull they will lose concentration easily and make their classmates lose it too .
to sum up , we must take advantage of story@@ telling to consoli@@ date concepts , values and emotions and let imagination go .
I live in one of the biggest cities in the country .
people who live in our city generally face transportation problems .
instead of long term solutions , local authorities focus on short term solutions .
the quality of public transportation vehicles can be increased .
new forms of public transportation must be supported by the government .
people should be convinced to use public transpor@@ ters .
the human brain is the most powerful computer known to man yet it is small and light .
it is the control centre of a body , it can instruct it to move freely around its surroundings , it is able to interact with other humans and objects .
the brain can make decisions , it can communicate .
the only function of the brain which computers can rival is memory .
some of the human brain functions have been taken over by computer . like accoun@@ tancy , with the invention of electronic calcul@@ ators .
in fact , the whole subject of mathematics has become quicker with the invention of the electronic calculator .
but the subject has not changed . electronics have only solved a few mathematical puzzles .
most of the theories used today were hypothe@@ si@@ sed and proved before the invention of the calculator .
computers , however , have almost unimaginable accuracy .
most high precision engineering projects undertaken today use computers and laser technology to make parts accurate to thous@@ and@@ ths of a milli@@ meter .
the computer is very widely used in the modern day world , but in almost every case it is only an aid to the brain .
the human still has to tell the computer what to do .
the human is still in charge .
the human brain is in no way made redundant by the invention of the computer and I think that it will be a long time before technology is discovered to make an electronic machine which will compete with the brain to achieve one of its functions never mind all of which the human brain is capable of doing .
Hello T@@ ara .
you are starting an amazing project for your life .
I know it is really difficult to start but then it starts being easier .
you can start by asking your teacher and your schoolmates if they want to be part of that .
they will probably say yes .
together you can decide what to do .
at my school I did that and it resulted .
we started by creating rules to respect the environment ... I do n&apos;t want to tell you more ideas because it is important to be original ,
good luck

if the rate of car ownership continues to increase at such a rapid rate , then the roads will be completely congested .
this is the main problem facing the UK &apos;s transport system .
the reasons for this are many and varied .
people of today want more freedom and have more disposable income , both factors which will lead to an increase in car ownership .
many people also feel unsafe to walk or to use public transport to get to places , and mothers who would have walked to school when they were young insist on fer@@ rying their children to school by car , as they believe , correctly or not , that there are too many child ab@@ duc@@ ters around for it to be safe for children on the streets .
these views are supported by cases like the James Bul@@ ger case , and the Fred and Mary West case which have very high publicity and give increasing public awareness to the people on the streets today .
people also use cars because they are more convenient than public transport , as they can travel whenever they wish , and can travel &quot; door - to - door &quot; instead of having to walk to bus stops and stations .
the enormous levels of vehicles on the roads have meant that using a bicycle to travel has become unacceptable to many people , due to the danger and also to the levels of pollution from cars on the streets .
rail travel has seen decreased popularity in recent years , due to the immense popularity of the car now .
some people may not use trains due to their seemingly unreliable services .
trains also fail to offer the freedom of choice available with cars , as the passengers are t@@ yed to the timetables and locations of railway stations .
I think that the government should help Bri@@ tains transport by aiming to decrease the amount of car use@@ age and increase the usage of buses , trains and other forms of public transport .
the government should do this by investing more money into public transport than into road improvements , such as the wid@@ ening of motorways .
this increased investment would lead to more attractive public transport , with more services on the timetables , lower rates and less delays .
these factors may make people convert from using their car to travelling to work or school and to using buses or trains instead .
this would lead to less congested roads , which could then be used efficiently by people with no other option , and a less polluted environment for all of us to live in .
this is because public transport is less polluting than private car usage .
scientists believe that it may not be safe to eat beef products .
several years ago the disease B@@ SE or &apos; Mad C@@ ow Disease &apos; became quite common@@ place amongst cattle .
the disease incur@@ s a mental deficiency , where the cow can not think for itself , and slowly dies .
this B@@ SE has been known to cross the animal barriers ; several sheep have had a similar disease after eating feed made from the remin@@ ants of dead , me@@ at@@ stri@@ pped cows .
now , scientists fear that it has crossed the boundary between cows and humans , as there are more and more cases of Cre@@ ut@@ z@@ feld - Jacob Disease ( C@@ J@@ D ) appearing more frequently .
there is , as of yet , no cure for this disease , and the only way humans could contract it would be by eating beef products .
this clearly has put a lot of people off beef , as the press also had coverage of inefficient quality control by the government , and the fact that this has been going on for years is worrying .
the disease can take up to 15 - 20 years to become evident in humans , so even if people gave up beef today , they will have a chance of getting C@@ J@@ B .
however , to give up the products now would reduce the chances of being crip@@ pled by this disease in the future .
if a lot of people did give up beef products , this would have had effects on the agricultural industry .
cattle farmers will be hit particularly badly if no - one wants to buy their meat .
it will affect other animals being sold for meat also ; more people will want to buy the meat from sheep and pigs and so on so they can still eat the same amount of meat .
the whole episode may send the price of beef down so people will buy it and take the risk ( which must be tiny ) rather than for@@ king out for more expensive meat products .
if no - one wants to eat beef then cows will only be br@@ ed for their milk , which means there will be less cows in the future possibly .
if cows are no longer required by the public for food , some ab@@ bat@@ to@@ ir workers may lose jobs , and several but@@ chers , to whom the money from beef products is a considerable percentage of their income , may be hit hard by this .
the politicians still say it is safe , and that they will continue to eat beef .
however , a lot of these people are old , and by the time the disease has developed in them it wo n&apos;t really be too much of a premature death .
however , for us young people is the risk too great ?
I haven&apos;t stopped eating it .
I am a mother tongue Italian final year student in stic stic medi@@ ation at the University of Rome .
English , French and German are the languages I am more confident with but I also speak a little bit of Russian and Finnish .
my degree course is primarily focused on foreign languages and cultures , anthropology and linguistic .
presently , I am an Italian teacher for foreigners , but I &apos;ve also translated Philos@@ ophy texts and Curriculum Vit@@ ae from Italian into English and vice versa .
no future for public transport in my country . yes , it is in fact overcrowded everywhere , besides pollution , with its huge numbers all over the city . do not forget rising prices for petroleum products . nowadays , travelling by car is more convenient , safer and cheaper .
dear Sir or Madam ,
I write to you with regards to the job vacancy entitled U@@ sa Summer camps advertised on the website Monster .
after reading the requirements carefully , I believe that I have the suitable skills to apply for this position .
I have ten years of experience working with children , as a coach in a tennis club .
I love this profession and I would like to keep on developing my professional career in this project .
I consider myself a very enthusiastic , motivated and helpful person and I would love to be part of your company as an instructor in this summer camp .
currently , I am studying the MA Children Care due to my interest in developing my professional career in this field .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .

I wake up at 4@@ :@@ 00am everyday , And start to work at 5@@ :@@ 30am .
because I finish work at 3:@@ 30pm , After work , I need to go to school .. and finish at 8@@ :@@ 45@@ pm , so After back home , I just take a shower , And have a small talk with my boyfriend , Then I got a bed at 11@@ :00pm .
sometimes we watch the film together if I have a day off .
on the weekend , we play basketball with friends once a month .
sometimes , we go bowling if all friends are free at night .
&quot; seven &quot; can be categorized as a chase and police film based on the several crimes that occur during the movie . what people consider is a moving gripping film .
the main characters were interpreted by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt . one of the most highly regarded facts was that in total the film gr@@ os@@ sed more than 3@@ 30 million euros in 1995 when the film was released .
it is directed by David Fin@@ cher who has also been in charge of &quot; The Curious Case of Benjamin Button &quot; and it is a paramount production .
the film narr@@ ates a series of murders that are related to the seven deadly sins ( l@@ ust , pride , w@@ ra@@ th , laziness , greed , glu@@ tt@@ ony@@ )@@ made by a psych@@ op@@ ath who left a mark on each victim to deduc@@ t the sin for which they had been killed .
this led to the research of two policemen that tried to fit perfectly well all the pieces of the crime , but it is going to be more difficult than they expected .
I personally think that this film is fast - moving and spine chilling . I find it astonishing . I freely appreciate that there is no way there is a happy ending and there are unpleasant scenes due to some murder scenes .
if you like mystery films , I strongly recommend it .
I sincerely hope this review convin@@ ces the reader to watch the film .
dear Joe ,
thanks for your letter .
I &apos;m very glad you have thought about visiting my country .
I &apos;m sure you will like it .
I can give you some tips for traveling , depending on what you like to do .
if you like museums , galleries and architecture , I would recommend you to visit our beautiful cities , like W@@ ro@@ cl@@ aw , Krakow , Poznan , G@@ dan@@ sk , and of course our capital Warsaw .
on the other hand , if you prefer nature and physical activity , you should rather think about going to our mountains - Su@@ de@@ ty or Kar@@ pat@@ y , or to Maz@@ uria region , full of lakes .
you may combine it as well .
for example , you may go by plane to Warsaw , visit the city , then take a trip to the north , including our sea - which , unfortunately , is n&apos;t the most warm and pretty sea in the world .
honestly , you can skip it without hesitating .
but our lakes are really worth visiting .
there are many possibilities there , to spend your free time .
you can go horse - riding , swimming , k@@ ate - surfing , fishing etc .
next , we could meet in W@@ ro@@ cl@@ aw .
I would show you the city , which I like very much .
then , I would take you to the mountains .
you may finish your trip in Krakow , and then look for a job there or in Warsaw .
there are our two biggest cities , with many students , and many job offers available .
as you speak Polish very little , it will also be the easiest way to find appropriate work for you , for an English - speaking company or so .
I believe Poland is a very good place for you .
the landscape is beautiful , and people are very friendly .
let me know if you need any more help .
looking forward to hearing from you soon .
best regards ,
E@@ wa
the 0@@ th Century In@@ vention that has had one of the most radical effects on people &apos;s lives is television .
during the 1950 &apos;s , America witnessed the begin@@ nings of a cultural revolution .
the era of Pop@@ ul@@ u@@ x@@ e insti@@ gated a &apos; must - have &apos; ideology in the nation and the most important &apos; must - have &apos; was , of course , the television .
the presence of television has brought about several crucial trends in our culture : the mass cul@@ turi@@ zation of various groups , the commercialization of our lifestyles , and the rap@@ idi@@ ty and breath of the information that reaches us .
gathered around the tube , the American family learned the &apos; ideal &apos; way of life .
but the picture of perfection was the same in every home .
we all received the same information .
we all saw the same families , The C@@ lea@@ vers and The Ander@@ sons , etc . telling how we should behave .
mother was always beautiful , father knew best , and children had cute , silly , harmless problems .
as a result of this omni@@ sci@@ ent picture , a farmer in I@@ owa had an idea of what a family in New York consisted of .
people in N.@@ Y. watched Green ac@@ res .
today the same trend continues .
to white people , gh@@ et@@ to life is slightly less of a mystery .
the examples on television are blown - up and exaggerated , but people get a general idea of different lifestyles .
rather than several small , isolated cultures , the united States is moving towards a mass cul@@ tur@@ alization
and the presence of another &apos;s reality in our homes is a major part of the reason .
another effect of television on people &apos;s lives is the commercialization of our lives .
advertisements , which originally served only to inform people of their purchasing options , have developed into an art form .
15 second blocks of our time are sold for millions of dollars and as a result the American population is made to laugh , or to cry , and often times to buy a product .
finally , and perhaps most importantly , the citizens of America have experienced w@@ / the advent of television a great increase in the amount of information they receive , as well as in the time it takes to reach them .
a hundred years ago , different sections of the country ( and world ) were isolated and separated by the time it takes to mail a letter and print a newspaper story .
today , we know within seconds , or in the case of the space - shuttle challenger explosion , we know live - immediately .
this abundance of information has lead to a drastic alter@@ ation in peoples ability to react to major events .
our view of the world is different , it &apos;s closer , it &apos;s in our living rooms .
a good example of this is the reaction to the Vietnam war .
the war was , indeed , unpopular with or with w / o television .
but the reality of what we saw , the casu@@ alty counts , the bloody children under the American flag , did much to enhance the negative aspects of war .
overall , television has caused a radical change in our lives -
we are open to manipulation as well as stimulation .
the television is a powerful and dangerous tool .
it can greatly enhance and improve our lives , but it is most important to be aware of the fact that it is a manipul@@ ator .
we must watch what we watch .
I do n&apos;t agree with the statement saying there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
when you decide to travel by car , it &apos;s certain that you feel independent , you can stop whenever you need , you can set off when you are ready and that is why travelling by car is said to be convenient .
however , there are sometimes more important things than feeling comfortable when travelling , like money . travelling by car is expensive , as the price of petrol is still increasing , because of limited natural resources .
although there are some places in the entire world where car - users can not complain about the price of petrol , there are also many more areas where people exchange driving cars for commuting or riding a bike as they ca n&apos;t afford to own a car .
nowadays we are much more aware of the environment .
thus , we know that using cars is harmful for the environment . we are advised to take public means of transport instead of travelling alone as it means less exhaust fumes per passenger .
what is more , in multiple countries there is a festival of public transport , when people celebrate travelling free by public transport and they are asked to leave their private car in the garage .
to sum up , in my opinion , public transport will remain as long as scientists do n&apos;t discover new natural resources of petrol or invent a cheap equivalent to charging cars with petrol .
we do not care about the big environment in China , but we only care about the environment in or around our own house .
we throw all kinds of housing waste into the same basket , and the cleaner will collect it .
sometime there will be odor remain , as the basket is indoor .
we do not care about the air , even though the air pollution is very serious in some parts of China .
we only choose the way which is convenient but may have a negative effect on our living environment .
dear Jo ,
Spain has many beautiful places you ought to see .
I think you should start off in Madrid , so we can meet . I &apos;ll show you around .
we &apos;ll go to all the touristic places and you &apos;ll get to try a lot of delicious food .
then you should visit Barcelona . it &apos;s a truly beautiful city with many must - see places , like the Sagrada Familia . also , you &apos;ll be able to go to the beach to relax .
from there on I think you could follow the coast and visit cities such as Valencia , Cart@@ ag@@ ena or Málaga during the summer and leave the inland cities for autumn .
as for working here , well , it &apos;s not going to be easy . we &apos;re having difficulties regarding that , but I guess you could find a part - time job at a restaurant or something . I could help you with sending your CV and all that .
and if everything fails , we can always ask my aunt . she owns a small shop in the city centre and she &apos;d be more than happy to have someone helping her out .
see you soon
Sam
Hi Jo ,
in my country there are a lot of chances to work and to have fun .
Italy is an enormous country full of culture and opportunities .
for example , I live in Jes@@ olo , near Venice , and here there are business company@@ ies , other hotels , other firms . if you want , you can also do the tourist guide .
on travelling in my view , I think that the best thing is to str@@ at , for example , from the bottom of Italy and visit all the amazing cities in these countries : Florence , Milan , Genoa , Rome , Venice .
there are also a lot of courses and other activities to do .
you have a lot of opportunities also with Universities .
Venice and Pad@@ ova are the most important cities for learning .
it &apos;s a great idea .
I hope I can see you soon , and I hope to be useful for your decision .
as you may already notice , Warsaw is a beautiful and big city .
it was really hard to choose one place that you just must visit .
obviously it largely depends on your interests .
if you want to know Warsaw from the historical side , I recommend visiting the Old Town and
the Royal Castle .
it would be helpful for you if you asked for a guide .
honestly , I think it is very educational , but a bit boring .
I am sure that , as young students , you will definitely more appreciate something less educational , but more interesting .
your must - visit place is The National Stadium .
I was there many times and trust me - there is a lot to see there .
it was built specially for E@@ UR@@ O 2012 .
we were host country , so we had to make as much effort as we could .
the first thing which attracts our attention is interesting architecture .
it looks like a red and white - it refers to Poland &apos;s flag - basket .
the stadium is also equipped with a heated pitch , training pitch , fa@@ ç@@ ade lighting , and underground parking .
there is even a railway station , situated on the opposite side , which was built in the same style as the stadium .
when you get there you will not be disappointed .
there are trips with a guide where you will hear the story of the Stadium , which , in my opinion , is very interesting .
you will also visit changing rooms where football players prepare for matches .
it is a Mul@@ ti@@ purpose venue able to host not only sporting events , but also concerts , cultural events , and conferences .
I really recommend visiting this place .
it would be an unforgettable and fascinating trip .
it would also be a great wind@@ fall for all football lovers .
you will not regret that , I promise .
life changes could be possible in the next years because actually a new way of life is appearing due to technological advantages .
when I look back I realise teenagers are different , they are looking for different things for their life .
for example , when I was young , all students used to study for several years to become experts and get a good job .
nowadays teenagers study only for a few years because they want to get a job quickly .
all around me is changing quickly , education , way of life , way of thinking , technology so I think all that will make a change in the life of the future .
in fact , I am looking forward to seeing this change and I hope this change will be as good as I expect . above all , I hope a big change in the health service will be made .
with economic development , a growing number of much - needed buildings are taking the place of areas of farmland , forest and wetland .
as far as I am concerned , this phenomenon does more harm to children as well as animals than good .
first , the large - scale buildings bring various kinds of pul@@ l@@ tions .
the process of building produces a large amount of marine rubbish as well as noise , which disturbs the life of inher@@ its around .
at the same time , the glass covering the surface of the sk@@ ys@@ rc@@ aper reflects da@@ x@@ zzling light .
besides , the de@@ story of the habitat fast@@ ens the extinction of wil@@ dings and reduces the diversity of species .
with no more trees and glasses to fresh the air , the air pollution will be more serious .
what &apos;s more , building housing much more than needed is the waste of so@@ city resources .
to solve those problems , stag@@ y@@ ies should be taken by the government .
first , measures should be made to protect the area of farmland , forest and wetland .
each city should be promised to own the least needed affordable area .
what &apos;s more , the government should encourage investment into environment - friendly projects instead of housing building .
the last is that
presents
with regard to a recent radio discussion about the positive and negative aspects of receiving presents such as lux@@ uries , homemade items or different live experiences , the decision is open to debate .
on the one hand , I strongly believe that people should receive presents at any time , whether it is for Christmas , Bir@@ th@@ days or just because you want to demonstrate someone how much you care for them .
life experiences are known for being the best type of present nowadays , as people finally understood the importance of memories for our lives , instead of just collecting lux@@ uries , clothes or photographs .
moreover , from my point of view , apart from having the amazing opportunity to receive this type of gift , you are able as well to share it with the people you love the most .
in addition , I do not actually find any disadvantage to this type of present .
on the other hand , homemade items are extremely agreeable to receive too .
not only are they made with true love , but they are also made , generally , with recycling products , such as glass , plastic and even wood .
the main advantage is the fact that , as was said before , the item was probably made with passion .
however , the person who receives the present may not like it at all .
that is the main disadvantage .
these ideas have led me to my conclusion : the best present to receive is experiences as you will always remember them , sharing them with your family and acquaintances .
my teaching philosophy changed considerably when I finished this course that was based on theories of second language acquisition .
until now , my beliefs in teaching English focus on the following opinions : ( I ) children should be familiar with English as early as possible ( ii ) the teacher should give students motivation so that they can gain their target goal in learning language ( ii@@ i ) teacher must be a good monitor in class ( haha ) the teacher must be well interaction with students .
my beliefs help me feel more confident to become an English teacher in the future .
first of all , parents should let their children learn English early .
my first misunderstanding is that adults will acquire a second language better than children .
by reading child language acquisition of S@@ LA , I know that the period that people can acquire the second language best is in childhood ( Mc@@ Lau@@ gh , 197@@ 8@@ a , as cited in g@@ ass and Sel@@ in@@ ker , 2008 , p.@@ 123 ) .
moreover , children at the age of 5 and 9 that are called critical period , they can acquire a second language naturally that does not need any special methods of teaching .
children have better phon@@ ology than adults and they display mor@@ ph@@ ological sensitivity that adults can not .
however , older learners will be successful in second language ( L@@ 2 ) syn@@ tax .
Pat@@ kom@@ ski ( 1980 ) found that learners who learned L@@ 2 after the age of pu@@ ber@@ ty received lower proficiency scores than learners who started learning L@@ 2 before pu@@ ber@@ ty .
therefore , in the future , I will encourage everyone to let their child make an acquaintance with English as early as possible to help their children have accent like native speakers .
if I have a chance to teach children , I will create an active atmosphere with various activities which focus on communications skills and give students opportunities to expose themselves with authentic input such as cartoons , music , etc .
secondly , the teacher should inspire students motivation and raise student &apos;s awareness in learning so that they can gain their target goal in learning language when I was in grade ten . I did not have willingness motivation to learn English because of my parents &apos; obligation .
consequently , my results do not meet the goal as my parents expected .
until I met a tutor invited by my parents , I passed the exam in class with a high mark , and I have motivation to learn better .
I want to become an English teacher .
motivation is the second most important factor in S@@ LA that makes students achieve in learning L@@ 2 ( S@@ ke@@ han@@ ,@@ 1989 , as cited in g@@ ass and Sel@@ in@@ ker , 2008 , p.@@ 4@@ 26 ) .
students can use their whole time to do what they are interested in , and they will never get bored .
the more motivated one has been in language learning , students will gain the more success .
it is really a long - term project that students can improve their proficiency in second language .
they need to observe a number of comprehensible input , and do many tasks to obtain their goal .
as a teacher , I will make efforts to increase the students frequency motivation because of its changes overtime D@@ ör@@ n@@ ye@@ i and O@@ tt@@ ,2007 ( 1998 ; and detailed in D@@ ör@@ n@@ ye@@ i , 2000 , 200@@ 1@@ a , as cited in g@@ ass and Sel@@ in@@ ker , 2008 , p.@@ 4@@ 28 ) .
Thirdly , the good teacher is the one that can well - organize all of the activities in class .
for instance , when I teach grammar , I have to define how much structure that I can teach in a lesson is enough , and with some difficult grammar rules , I need to break it to teach in turn .
learners need time to memory the new rule and acquire in their learned system .
after teaching the rule , I will ask my students to work in pairs and communicate using the new structure based on my cu@@ e cards .
when they are working , I can hear their conversation and know not only what they say but also how they say , so I can know whether they have acquired the rules or they just use their learned knowledge .
finally , interaction is also an interesting theory .
g@@ ass ( 2003 ) found that &quot; language learning is stimulated by the communication of pressure and the relationship between communication and acquisition and the mechanisms &quot; .
therefore , I will teach my students English only , I will let them have more chance to communicate with other people through my tasks that I give them in class , then I will move around the class room and correct mistakes for them by negotiation , re@@ casts or feedback .
when observing their dialogue , if they make mistakes , I will take note and after they finish their practice , I will correct them for them .
I advise interrupting their speech because it is un@@ respected by them .
in addition , if I always correct mistakes , my students will lose their confidence and they would not like to practice anymore .
this is my philosophy on foreign language teaching .
these beliefs help me examine what I am going to do in the future when I become an English teacher .
this course widens my knowledge a lot through the theories in S@@ LA book .
I think that students in school of foreign language education must learn this course to have a better philosophy of teaching .
the aim of this report is to describe how my town takes care of the environment and what people do with respect to the issue .
firstly , I am going to talk about what my town does .
the town is generally clean , thanks to the clean services .
every night roads are cleaned and rubbish is frequently collected during the day .
even if the clean service is very efficient , people do n&apos;t usually take care of the environment .
they throw their wr@@ app@@ ers away on the ground .
in other words , citizens do n&apos;t completely worry about the place where they live .
the town has implemented a programme to solve this problem by promoting prizes to anyone who takes action against these bad behaviour .
as a result of this new policy , the town is now more attractive and cleaner than in the past .
residents have changed their bad habits and the image of the town has improved .
in conclusion , thanks to the new living method , tourists are more attracted and curious to visit it and the town has reduced the costs to clean .
the amount of money saved is used to build new green areas across the town .
European nations have over time been linked together both in war and in Peace .
these countries have since been moving closer together on more institu@@ tional lines .
one such demonstration of this has been the forming of the European Community , made up of the European Co@@ al and St@@ eel Community , the European Atomic Energy Community and the European Economic Community .
in 1987 , the European Community adopted the single European Act in which the member countries committed themselves to the realisation of a single internal europ@@ ean market by 1992 .
this act has raised questions in Britain as to whether or not it will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain .
the lifting of trade barriers between the member states will enable the free movement of trade .
this economic union will not really create a loss of sovereignty for Britain , as it will merely aid the exchange of goods throughout Europe .
however , the fears are that the act will lead to decisions being imposed on Britain since an important element of it is the commitment to majority rule rather than the previously common practice of consensus decision making in the council of ministers .
this would result in the ability of individual nations to ve@@ to key decisions being restricted .
British sovereignty could be in danger if this union led to a European government imposing its authority on Britain .
a centr@@ alised European government would inhibit Britain &apos;s decision - making ability .
the recent incident of the europ@@ ean Parliament imposing its ideals on Britain points out the authoritative principles to which it may be forced to accept if such a strong central body was created .
it is believed that Britain ought to halt construction on the Channel Tun@@ nel link due to environmental concerns . however , this action seemed to be an im@@ position on Britain &apos;s sovereignty as an external body was trying to tell the country what to do .
if the European Community was to bring in a single currency , Britain may be deprived of its sovereignty since it will lose its individuality , but more importantly would forget its bar@@ gaining position on the foreign exchange .
currency decisions would be made by a central body which Britain would have to accept .
if a single Europe should lead to British troops fighting on behalf of Europe instead of its own nation , most sovereignty would be lost .
it would mean a su@@ pr@@ an@@ ational force fighting as a whole , with no real difference between them - it would not be a case of &quot; one force , one nation &quot; .
however , the state would still exist as an island and people will always feel that they were British due to their roots and history .
this even if linked physically to Europe via the Channel Tun@@ nel , Britain would still see itself as a separate country .
I personally believe that Britain will not lose its sovereignty if the union is based on an economic level of free trade between nations .
however , if a strong European government was created which made important decisions for Britain , such as currency sett@@ le@@ ments and the running of its foreign policy , this would mean that Britain would no longer be an individual state with the power to make its own decisions , and would hence lose its sovereignty .

this graph shows data of the amount of petrol used between the United States and the United Kingdom .
as it is known , these countries are one of the most powerful regions around the world .
firstly , the United States line expresses that the majority of income percentage is spent by the poor@@ est socioeconomic class .
secondly , the amount of money used for cars has decreased by the richest drivers .
however , this patron is not the same as the other place .
in the first place , we can appreciate a percentage of capital used on gas which is raised by wealthy people who live in the United Kingdom .
in the second place , the lowest incomes are reported on British citizens who are from a poor socioeconomic status .
once and for all , either the United States of America or the United Kingdom have a similar patron .
according to the richest drivers , both lines are linked in the same place .
dear Summer Camp holder :
Hi !
this is Mimi .
I am an outgoing girl enjoying being alone with people very much .
a few years ago , I was an elementary school teacher , quitting such a nice job due to my dream of being a nurse , but that would be an obstacle slowing me down to getting along with these cute little angels .
thus , I have a profound believe in myself to do this job well .
by the way , I once joined a summer camp during my college life .
a role model who was the same as this job , like preparing meals and snacks , holding games and giving them surprise , and taking good care of them and so on .
though it may seem that having to do so much will be extremely exhausting for me , both my experience and instinct tell me that it would be a great time with a beautiful memory left in my life .
either hard or frustration could not change my decision , only try the difficulty could a person get improved and find his way in life .
above all , thank you for giving me such an opportunity to show myself .
if I could be your partner , that would be my greatest pleasure .
hope all of you enjoy a nice day .
your friend , Mimi
dear Lionel Messi ,
I &apos;m writing to you to persuade you with some information that you probably do n&apos;t know about .
I would like to say that you should give more money to charity and I think you should be paid much less than you do now .
firstly , I would like to say that you should be paid much less than you do now .
because you get paid about £ 3@@ 30@@ .@@ 000 per week .
so can you think about doctors and nurses . they save lives almost every day and you are not doing anything , just playing football and having some fun with your friends .

therefore , you should be paid about £ 250 per game .
I think that is a huge amount of money anyway .
in other words , I think you should give more money to charity because they need your help .
so I would say that in 1960s , the wage limit of money was about £ 4-@@ <eos> 7 per week .
it took about 20 years for that wage limit to double to £ 8@@ -@@ <eos> 14 per week in 1980s .
when I was a kid , I was addicted to reading stories for children .
in my teens too , I used to read a lot of teen novels so much that my mother used to repro@@ ach me for sitting too long reading instead of doing my school work .
luckily , I managed to do both , and I remember studying hard in order to get a real chance to read whatever I wanted without my mother &apos;s consent .
today , I realized how reading these stories got me interested in writing .
I always wondered how you start to recognize yourself as a writer and how you become an effective one .
of course , a good writer must first be a good reader .
this is how I got my ambition to write .
reading stories , poems , and novels intrigued me to write my own .
reading what my fellow writers here said of their experiences as writers , what pushed them to write , what made them go on , and how it made them feel - all of that gave answers to my questions .
more than that , I found insights into my own mo@@ tives and goals as a writer .
I liked the close relationship of Shir@@ ley Car@@ re@@ ira with her father and his library .
I enjoy being intimate with my books .
I love the feel and smell of them , and I prefer them over electronic versions all the time .
they make you feel like you are in touch with the magic they offer .
books draw you in as if by a spell .
Michael is a very popular guy . he is very intelligent and he enjoys going to hear the history of ghosts and strange things .
one day his friend told him to go to a cabin , because strange things were happening there ; he accepted immediately .
on Saturday they were walking around the street looking for the cabin and they met an old very old cabin .
they saw a horrible ghost and he asked them two questions about his life but the guys said nothing and the ghost was furious okay said he , the second question : how many years do I have ?
Michael was nervous because he did not know anything about it .
the ghost said : Michael said to me who want to save your family or your friend you can only save one the other person will die .
Michael , after ten seconds , said this : I saved my family . Michael said I am a sorry friend and he ran far away when Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
although Louise felt nervous , she realised this was the opportunity of a lifetime .
that was her objective that she had been dreaming of for many years .
if I make a decision , there will be no getting back . I have to think over it .
she was speaking to herself .
she could let her parents down .
their expec@@ tant was to send her to one of the most prestigious medical universities .
alas , she was not sure if they care for her opinion .
due to being a hum@@ anist , Science was not the field that she was keen on .
Louise had been given a chance to go abroad .
she did not mind working long hours at entertaining places or earning little money .
her spirit was crying for leaving her country for the United States .
she could not say if it was a judi@@ cious feeling .
generally , Louise was said to be an in@@ decisive person , which can be noticed especially in such cases .
the advantages of leaving weigh up the drawbacks .
her parents seemed not to be over the moon .
the girl convinced them and made them realise that there was no world &apos;s &quot; end &quot; if she had chosen her own way .
everyone is afraid of something , but a lot of people are more afraid than of catastrophic events than of things like cancer .
even though people are scared about these things , they continue to smoke and drink alcohol .
some of our fears are instin@@ ctive so we automatically respond to danger before we have even had time to think about it .
our fear makes us act instinctively , we react so quickly and we save ourselves .
this type of fear is a necessary and life - saving response .
there are different kinds of fear , for example phobias .
we experience phobias in situations not dangerous for our safety .
many people have phobias , but they do n&apos;t threaten their lives every day .
scientists say that phobias arise from negative experiences or tra@@ um@@ as and that are difficult to control , but that could be prevented with the right therapy .
we know what fear is thanks to the experience and culture .
we were born with small and basic fears but we know that things like terrorism are dangerous . stories on TV , the internet , newspapers , increase the risk of extraordinary events and often influence our fears , leading us to worry about things that do n&apos;t happen ever to us .
to better enjoy our life without being op@@ pressed by our fears , we must be objective as we watch programs on TV and pay more attention to what happens around us .
international SP@@ OR@@ TS monthly : swimming
when I was younger I used to swim , and this is my favourite sport now .
when I am swimming , I like the sensation of flowing through the water .
my advice would be : enjoy the water !
enjoy your time swimming !
when you start to swim , you are learning a lot of new techniques . it &apos;s like discovering a new world . I do n&apos;t swim for participating in a competition but I swim to have fun .
the continual development of computer technology has created a great deal of controversy in modern times .
there are nowadays widespread uses for computers in all parts of society .
one area which has drawn particular criticism is the computer games industry .
since the early 1980 &apos;s , when computers such as the Spe@@ c@@ trum 48 K and the Com@@ mod@@ ore 64 were introduced into the homes of millions of people , controversy has followed about their effect on children .
there is a widespread belief among parents that computer games hinder a child &apos;s ability to learn .
the development of more sophisticated and technologically advanced computers , such as the am@@ iga and PC , has served to deepen the &quot; problem &quot; .
the growing realism of the games appeal strongly to children .
however , parents feel that children should be broadening their minds by reading books and that the computer games industry is encouraging children not to learn .
computers have also been blamed for a fall in education standards among primary school children ; a belief acc@@ ent@@ uated by the results of surveys which state that the vast majority of primary school children are unable to do simple arithmetic in their minds and rely on another computer , the calculator , to help them .
another moral dilemma that computers have created is their role in the workplace .
there are many people who fear that computers will eventually replace men in the workplace .
the role of computers is already significant in employment areas , such as accoun@@ tancy , which require a specialist ability to be able to calculate and manipulate numbers .
these computers have replaced humans and such changes have sparked fears that the level of unemployment could vastly increase as a result .
as computers are : more efficient than humans , do not require payment for their work , are less temper@@ am@@ ental than humans and will never have a day off because it is ill . it seems mankind is faced with a great problem .
another claim made that suggests the human brain could become useless is that computers promote anti - social behaviour .
the creation of the World Wide Web and the Internet have created concern that the human race will become un@@ sociable .
the Internet allows you to correspond with people all over the world and it also contains many other functions to , supposedly , make life easier for us .
the Internet also has another fundamental problem according to many .
the belief exists that the computer age and its developments , such as the Internet , will remove the challenges from life .
the human brain is constantly in need of being challenged to maintain itself ; but with the introduction of the Internet , one could conduct their life without ever needing to leave the house , which many believe would menace society .
however , at the moment , the existence of computers is very much dependent on the existence of humans .
no matter how much artificial intelligence a computer may be able to show , it still has to rely on the human brain to programme it and to put it into operation .
although there are plans to create computers which can programme themselves , ( which I , personally , feel is a very dangerous idea ) the human brain still very much controls the computer and still has the ability to end the existence of computers at any given moment ; thankfully , a powerful computer does not have over humans .
since I have been studying in Australia , compared with China , I realised there &apos;s a significant difference in English study .
formally , Chinese teachers would adopt cramming methods and pay attention to grammar and vocabulary .
however , in comparison , the English Academic Program ( EAP ) class encouraged independent learning and provided me with more opportunities to interact and converse with classmates .
after studying the EAP , I have found that time management is my weakness .
therefore , I will discuss more about study strategies through reading related resources .
time management is a crucial factor for productive learning .
firstly , as described by the Academic Skills Unit ( 2012 ) , time management can be achieved by making a &quot; daily planner &quot; ( p.@@ 23 ) .
so I downloaded a daily planner and filled it with my study plans .
doing this helps to complete my daily tasks more efficiently .
secondly , the research of Mark ( 2006@@ ,@@ p.@@ 25 ) also states that scattered time in a day should be utilised and made more productive .
for instance , I looked for chances to talk to native speakers while waiting for the train , or participated in conversation actively during my breaks .
I have learnt that small bits of time added together can be used very productively .
in conclusion , by researching and comparing study strategies , I discovered time management is crucial to achieving productive learning .
however , to become a better learner , it is also important for students to stay focused and motivated .
in my future studies , apart from spending my time more productively , I will also set manag@@ eable short - term goals and review my plans regularly based on my study target .
Hello , my name is Xi@@ aw@@ u K@@ am . I am nine years old this year . today I am going to write about my favourite sport . my favourite sport is basketball because playing basketball can keep me fit and fun !

as I told you , new people have come to the office .
we have established a wonderful relationship , especially with one of them .
he is very outgoing , very friendly .
he has got a fantastic sense of humor and he always makes me laugh so I can forget the bad moments .
he is very polite , generous , honest .
at work he is a creative person . as you know , this is very important in our job . he always has an idea when the rest ca n&apos;t think anything .
however he can be a bit in@@ mad@@ ure at times .
he is very keen on sports . his favourite sport is basketball , like me .
it &apos;s a pleasure to be with him and really enjoy his company .
I think we fit in a lot , we have a lot of things in common , nearly we have the same likes and dislikes .
he is a talkative person , no me , as you know I am a bit shy .
but I do n&apos;t think it will be a problem .
I must leave you know , it &apos;s time to work .
love
Kra@@ shen &apos;s theory is one of the most known and influential acquisition theories from the seven@@ ties .
Kra@@ shen presented this theory during several years in works .
it was clu@@ stered in his great work : the input hypothesis : issues and implications ( 1985 ) and it can be summarized in the next hypothesis :
• the Ac@@ quisition - Learning hypothesis ,
• the Mon@@ itor hypothesis ,
• the Natural Order hypothesis ,
• the In@@ put hypothesis
• the Aff@@ ective Fil@@ ter hypothesis .
the Ac@@ quisition - Learning is perhaps the most fundamental of all the hypothe@@ ses to be presented here .
it states that adults have two distinct and independent ways of developing competence in a second language .
on the one hand , we have the acquisition that , according to Kra@@ shen , is the unconscious process children have since they were born to develop their ability in their first language .
language learners are not usually aware of the fact that they are acquiring that language .
they are not aware of the rules , they speak without thinking that what they are saying is correct , and they do not stop to think about the errors they commit because they do not think they are doing it wrongly .
some things &quot; sounds &quot; good , and others do not .
on the other hand , we have the learning process ; it implies the developing of competence in the second language .
we use the term learning ; to refer to the conscious knowledge we have of the second language , to be aware of the rules , for example .
some theorists say that children acquire , but that adults can not do it , they just learn .
but according to Kra@@ shen , the acquisition - learning process says that adults , can also acquire , the ability of picking - up languages , does not disappear when we grow up .
but at the same time , it does not mean that adults can always achieve the native language levels , or that they can have access to the same natural &quot; language acquisition device &quot; that children use , it is so different .
acquisition is a powerful process in adults .
acquisition can not be converted into learning and in the other way round .
there are two different processes . acquisition is the most important one , because we have to control , first , the mother language , and after that , the learning of more languages .
an application for teaching , according to this theory , could be that the optimal way a language is learned is through natural communication .
as a second language teacher , the best thing is to create a situation where language is used in order to fulfil authentic purposes .
this will help students , children or adults , to acquire the language instead of learning it .
sport makes you test your limits .
you need to get am@@ b@@ icious , to improve , to convince .
for me , it &apos;s sym@@ ply passion .
it &apos;s been for ever that I loved basketball .
no matter if I followed professionals on TV or watched the students on the basketball court in school - the fascination always caught me instantly .
when I was 7 years old , my father used to motivate me .
if I scored 10 times in a row from the same point , he would take me to the ki@@ osk and let me choose as many sweets as I could manage to eat .
of course I could n&apos;t make it .
but I did n&apos;t give up .
after many weeks , hours of training and countless frustrating moments , my precision improved .
my father was stunned .
he could n&apos;t believe that a young boy like me was able to hit so many points .
the following day , I was rewarded with the promised sweets .
even 10 years later , my motivation did n&apos;t change .
1 . Scar@@ let letter box is one of the most recognizable symbols of England
2 . there is no doubt that most young people want to be white - collar workers .
3 . all my neighbors want to vote for the Gre@@ ens .
4 . I saw amazing cri@@ m@@ son sunset yesterday
5 .
he spent his holidays near turquoise sea .
6 .
my friend was against the Re@@ ds and it was one of the reasons why he left his country .
7 .
she is in a blue mood because she lost her job .
8 .
honey which I bought on market near my home has am@@ ber tin@@ t .
10 . that old lady looks a bit green .
introduction
first of all , this report is concerned with how you spend your shopping time in Al@@ bac@@ ete .
Al@@ bac@@ ete is too easy to walk around the city center where you can come across most of the shops .
suggestions
in the commercial zone you can find two small shopping centers .
all of them have the main street between them and one is in front of each other .
these two are not so big however , there are two or three small shops really original .
in contrast , I would mention two big shopping centers in my city .
all of them are on outskirts and there are :
- E@@ ros@@ ki where you can find a lot of different shops .
most of them presents in the city center too .
- El cor@@ te Ing@@ l@@ és , where you can buy a lot of different brands along its 5 floors .
conclusion
from my point of view , it is more attractive to the city center than the shopping centers .
it is a little bit stressful for me . in contrast , I prefer a relaxing walk looking through shop windows to an indoor shopping center .
but it depends on how shopping addict you are .
Hi Dan
thank you for your letter .
how are things ?
I am fine .
would you mind going with me this Saturday ?
this Saturday is my birthday &apos;s mum .
yesterday I bought her a new television although she has got an old one but it is horrible .
this evening I am inviting her to the cinema .
we are watching Spiderman and after we are going to Bur@@ gu@@ er King beca@@ uses she likes it however I do n&apos;t like it but there &apos;s no accounting for taste .
transport is an important activity in any country .
the advent of technology has been bringing about drastic changes in means of transportation from time to time .
at the same time , transport has become a very important means of development for any nation as all nations are moving towards globalization .
public transportation has been playing a very important role in transporting people from one place to the other .
the bulk production and marketing of cars has been reducing the role of Public Transpor@@ tation .
cars have become accessible to everybody .
people have preferred cars to public transportation .
this trend is very dangerous to the world .
this would raise air pollution .
burning of fossil fuels would increase and this would increase air pollution .
public transportation should be more attractive and cost effective .
governments should encourage people to use public transportation .
people should come forward to prefer public transport to their own vehicles .
the main problem in the United Kingdom is B@@ SE or as it is so - called &quot; Mad C@@ ow Disease &quot; .
it has been discovered that the disease can be transmitted to humans due to consumption of the infected beef .
beef production is a fairly large business in the U.@@ K and it was necessary to discover more about this relatively new disease .
it was discovered that British farmers were to blame , due to their various industrial techniques .
the disease originally , was carried by chickens .
when the farmers killed the chickens for their meat , the remains ( bone and organs ) were processed to provide a cheap feeding product .
unfortunately the disease carrying organs was not just fed back to chickens but to cows as well .
the cows contracted the disease ( in a slightly different form ) and this was when &quot; B@@ SE &quot; first came about .
the correct thing to do would have been to destroy the infected cows , bringing an end to a potentially life - threatening situation .
however , the farmers had money involved and did not .
when the infected cows were sl@@ augh@@ tered for beef , their remains were processed and fed back to other cattle spreading the disease further .
unfortunately , unlike chickens , the cattle were able to pass this disease on to humans in their beef .
the same industrial techniques are still used today , and with the people in the UK becoming aware of the facts and more health conscious , the sales of beef have decreased .
it is impossible to learn that you have contracted the disease for up to seven years .
and so , some attitudes of the public are : &quot; why should I stop eating beef if I already have B@@ SE ? &quot; .
another public attitude is to ignore warnings as there have not been any victims .
but it seems that the most popular option is to be safe and quit beef entirely .
it seems that more and more families have opted for chicken , pork or lamb as an alternative .
it could have devastating effects on the agricultural industry as well .
if there is a point where supply outweighs demand , farmers will produce less beef and make less money .
it is therefore conceivable to think that farmers will change from beef to an alternative product .
the doorbell rang when I was staying at home and thinking about my lost little cat .
if you knew my pet cat , you would n&apos;t surprise my love to him .
his name was Tim@@ os@@ hka and he was n&apos;t as ordinary as other cats .
he was very intelligent and could understand my words .
he always knew my voice and my mood .
if I remember ri@@ ghtly , I found him when he was sitting next to my house in the street .
he was so dirty that I could n&apos;t see him in the darkness .
his green eyes only were shining there .
I was pity on him and took this one into my home .
after having a bath he changed into a white kitten like a snowball .
well , I came to my door and opened it .
there was a little girl who was living near me .
she was holding something little and dirty .
to my big surprise , this something was a cat !
this cat was mine !
how happy I was !
the topic of environmental conservation and prevention of pollution is very keen not only in my city but around the whole country .
many people are concerned about enhancing productive wastes , garbage on the streets and lack of effective processing .
nowadays we still use traditional ways of recycling and rubbish gathering .
one crucial point is that we do not have sorting system by type of rubbish .
we collect our wastes in one bag and then throw them into the special containers which are placed in each city area .
time to time , approximately twice a week this rubbish is un@@ loaded into vehicles and taken away to recycling sites .
it is difficult to imagine this further process but we know exactly that plastic and rubber waste is recycled .
regarding other stuff , I think it could be put into containers and dug under the ground for conservation .
but there are few steps in this direction from our officials - a new recycling factory was built in a suburb and started to function last year .
but on the other hand , many citizens complain about shortage of garbage baskets and containers on the streets of our city .
sometimes we may see such pictures as someone throwing away litter straight to an embankment or a sidewalk in the center of the city polluting the streets .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .
right after she got to work , where she was nothing but a typical underestimated office worker , Anna had been informed that she ought to go see her boss and prepare to be eaten alive because of the last report .
once she set foot in his office , she was surprised by a crowd of people yelling &apos; Happy birthday ! &apos; .
literally everybody was there , even her husband Adam who was holding their disabled daughter in his arms . &apos;
I &apos;ve got a real stun@@ ner for you , Anna , &apos; said her boss , smiling like a Che@@ shire cat , &apos;
due to my upcoming retirement , I was ordered to find my replacement .
I told the management that you were the perfect choice . &apos;
Anna was thrilled to bits - after all these years she was going to become a manager !
and yet another surprise was about to happen .
her skirt was being pulled , out of the blue - Anna looked down and noticed her 5@@ -year - old daughter standing still on her disabled legs .
it was truly astonishing !
she fell on her knees with tears of joy running down her cheeks .
she felt like she was on cloud nine .
suddenly her whole body started to shake .
Adam was standing at the hospital bed , staring at his wife &apos;s body con@@ vul@@ sions .
after long years being in a deep coma , Anna &apos;s family finally lost their hope and chose euthan@@ asia with an aching heart .
the teenage daughter silently shri@@ e@@ ked and buried her head in Adam &apos;s chest .
shaking stopped and the long monotonous sound confirmed that Anna had just left this world for a better place .
now she could just constantly celebrate her birthday with the beloved family .
I must say I strongly agree that shopping is not always an enjoyable experience .
to begin with , standing in a queue can get you a terrible headache .
only ten minutes is just enough in the atmosphere of people shouting and ha@@ ggling over every last penny .
every once in a while , when you get home after shopping , it can turn out that you just bought a real pig in a poke .
the food might not have a proper freshness , especially when it comes to dairy and meat products .
not only people ca n&apos;t afford to buy expensive products , but they also spend too much money on useless goods .
it appears that the shop policy is very relevant in this particular matter .
it &apos;s common to put products on special offers and hire some good - looking sales@@ people so it &apos;s almost impossible to refuse them .
as they say , you can shop till you drop !
on the other hand , it &apos;s not necessary to purchase anything at all .
people are shopping around these days again and again in order to compare various prices , are n&apos;t they ?
it &apos;s funny , but they always seem to be in search of the biggest bargain in their life .
there is no doubt that browsing at the mall and not buying can be as tiring as breaking the bank .
introduction for a paper
supply chain involves the management and information provider of many areas in a company . it goes since the selection of raw materials , the processing of raw materials to finished goods , and transportation of finished goods or products to end in the customers .
the main parts are suppliers , production and distribution .
one important task is the information provided in each area in order to create a logical connection between these main parts to approach the objective of selling a good quality product with reduction in costs and time .
the definition of a stand@@ arized process is the stab@@ li@@ shment of the same method to be applied in the production of certain activities or functions .
this method is already accepted with the required parameters .
a standardized product is the result of a standardized process .
for example , the production of a Coco - Cola bottle in Brazil has to be the same as the production of a Coca - Cola bottle in Australia .
a stand@@ arized product must not have big devi@@ ations , in order to sell the same product for all customers .
transport essentially constitu@@ tes our movement .
cars ca n&apos;t always be affordable by all sections of society .
public Transport should be op@@ tim@@ ally run in accordance with the demand .
public spending should be spent appropriately to ensure the maximum benefit done to the public .
drive down any street in urban America and you will see young males and females , both black and white , driving P@@ ath@@ fin@@ ders , BM@@ W@@ s , Mercedes , and other luxury automobiles .
how do these young people acquire the funds to afford such expensive rides ?
they dress in Kar@@ l Kan@@ i , pe@@ le pe@@ le , and Gu@@ ess ? clothing .
they wear C@@ arti@@ er wrist@@ watches and expensive Nike foot@@ wear .
where do the funds come from to purchase these fashions ?
in many cases the answer is simple : crime .
as unfortunate as it may sound , many youths are well aware of the fact that crime pays ; and it pays well .
what alternative does an inner - city youth have when faced with in@@ escap@@ able poverty ?
the answer becomes apparent when he or she is often surrounded by criminals living larger than those taking a more &quot; conservative &quot; path to financial security .
the philosophy is simple : if you want it , go get it -- at any cost .
the consequences are few , especially when one considers the shoc@@ kingly low percentage of criminals who actually end up in jail .
the only danger that exists for a criminal comes from other criminals trying to take what &apos;s theirs .
police are no threat as they are far out@@ num@@ bered ; it is virtually a game of chance as to whether one gets caught in an act of crime .
fortunately for the criminals , these odds are drastically in their favor . the public calls for more police but refuse to pay the taxes needed to hire them . .
the few police on the street are thus often left chasing criminals like a dog chasing its tail .
if a criminal is appreh@@ ended , and in an odd circumstance is placed in jail for non - violent crime , it is only a matter of time ( often a short amount of time ) before he or she is free to return to the wealth and comfortable living supported by bur@@ gl@@ ary , mu@@ gging , dealing , or simple con games .
jail space is reserved for murderers and rap@@ ists first ( as it should be ) , and when a murderer is convic@@ ted and sentenced , a dealer is put back on the street .
what an ordinary citizen imag@@ ines when he or she witnesses or hears about a non - violent crime is a thu@@ g bent on destroying society : killing babies , smoking as much weed as he or she can get his or her hands on , etc .
in reality these criminals are merely working a job that pays them better than any other .
why work at McDonalds where you are forced to work in a hot , cr@@ amped atmosphere , possibly with an over@@ bearing boss who is stuck in a service job with no en in sight , making $ 5@@ .00 an hour and shopping at K - Mart for clothes ?
it is obvious that crime pays .
the proof exists on any street in urban America : under@@ privileged youth rolling in luxury automobiles and rolling w@@ ads of money into their designer jeans .
this is less of a choice than it is an act of taking advantage of an opportunity .
there are few alternatives for low - income youths , and fewer obstacles in the quest for cash .
with violent crime rising and financial support for more police falling , crime will continue to pay .
if you are looking for a film about teenage first love to watch on a rainy day , I recommend you to watch En@@ dless Love .
this is a remake of the 1981 Franco Zeffirelli film , but instead of an age difference , there &apos;s a class difference .
directed by Sh@@ ana F@@ este , the film shows the thro@@ as of teenage first love , when David , the smart , decent , blue - collar guy who &apos;s happy to go into business with his father as a mechanic , falls in love with J@@ ade , a wealthy , shel@@ tered and studi@@ ous girl with plans to attend Brown University .
the class difference between their families becomes a great deal for both .
the films features Alex P@@ et@@ ti@@ fer and Gabri@@ ella Wil@@ de in the lead roles .
with his handsome face and gentleman acti@@ t@@ ude , and his perfect si@@ lu@@ ete , both try to live with their different lifestyles together .
they will fight against everything to protect their innocent love .
both act their parts perfectly but there are brilliant performances from the rest of the cast as well .
another thing about this movie that you will love is the cinem@@ at@@ ographic effects .
the romantic scenes and the music produce the perfect atmosphere for this type of film .
finally , the script is wonderful , lovely and touching , like David and J@@ ade should be .
if you enjoy che@@ esy love movies , I definitely recommend you watch En@@ dless Love .
it is un@@ denied that housing and transport networks are very important for us . plenty of people choose to build these in the areas of farmland , forest and wetland , which destroy the animals &apos; living areas and pollute the environment we live in .
in my opinion , it is time for governments to take measures .
to begin with , the energy in the world is limited . in other words , what we eat and what we need is depend on farming and forest . if we run out of resources , building more large - scale buildings , finally there would be a disaster .
as for the animals , serious large - scale buildings are built . they can not live in the forest , and have to move into other places . according to the China Daily , it has been published that three elephants came into the town , and ate the crops . that is because their habitats were built into roads . many kinds of animals have to change their living habits , adapting to what the people have done .
for the sea species , many visiting boats are put into the sea , polluted the ocean , leading to high death rates .
to solve these intr@@ act@@ able problems , the governments need to take measures .
for example , education is the key to raise people@@ &apos;@@ re@@ sp@@ om@@ si@@ bil@@ ty , go@@ ven@@ r@@ nment can teach through the public medi@@ a.@@ the ac@@ an also allow the organizations to go around the world , spread the prom@@ bles the areas had de@@ stor@@ ye@@ d@@ .@@ these perhaps l@@ om@@ g tern solutions , but they are more realistic sol@@ uc@@ tion@@ a than setting up yet another international organization .
one of the greatest inventions of all time is a television .
the invention that swept the world and changed leisure habits for countless millions was pione@@ ered by Scottish - born electrical engineer John Lo@@ gie Ba@@ ird .
it had been realised for some time that light could be converted into electrical impul@@ ses , making it possible to transmit such impul@@ ses over a distance and then re@@ convert them into light .
and now it has become one of the most important mass media .
millions of people all over the world like to watch TV in their spare time .
it informs , educates and entertains them .
it influences the way people look at the world and makes them change their views .
TV simply helps us to relax after a hard day &apos;s work , giving a great variety of entertaining and musical programs .
but there are some opinions that television is doing a lot of harm .
people begin to forget how to occupy their free time .
it prevents them from communicating with each other , from visiting friends , or relatives .
and indeed , people used to have hobbies . they used to go outside for amusement to the theatres , cinemas , sporting events .
they used to read books and listen to music .
now all free time is given to television .
still , it &apos;s not a good thing for children to be glued to the TV screen all day long .
it &apos;s very harmful for their health and for developing personalities , because children prefer low - standard hits , horror films or ban@@ al serials .
I &apos;m not such a passionate TV viewer .
in fact I only watch those programs that I find interesting and helpful .
I relax when I watch musical shows , humorous programs and TV games .
to my mind , all these things depend on the lifestyle of people .
nevertheless , television has obviously changed society , and it &apos;s probably used more than any other type of mass media .

I am very knowledgeable about children and what they like to do in their free time .
I am confident that I would be able to help these children to spend time very active .
however , I am good at cooking as well . I would be able to help you with cooking , if you will need any help .
I am very knowledgeable about health food which I do very often at home on my own .
I would be more than happy if you chose me for this job , as I am certain I could make a valuable contribution to your Summer camps .

yours faithfully ,
Anton@@ ina Ch@@ l@@ ud@@ zin@@ ska
my name is Car@@ o Gu@@ ti@@ er@@ rez and I &apos;m from Mexico . I am the type of person that likes being around children , helping them with their needs to make things easier for them .
on the other hand , I have the ability to manage different sports , like swimming , basketball , volleyball and softball .
I like to work in a clean and organized kitchen .
I also like to have handy all the required kitchen tools as well as the material needed to prepare a meal .
I would enjoy working in this summer camp if you gave me the opportunity and will be looking forward to hearing from you .
dancing your problems away
dancing has been my favourite sport since I was very small .
I learned from my parents how good it feels to move your body and perhaps , without them , I would n&apos;t be right now in a street dance crew while taking ballet lessons .
does n&apos;t it just make everyone feel positive about dancing ?
throughout history , dancing has developed into an easy task and everyone can learn it .
recent studies show that , whenever you are down@@ cast or having issues , this sport stimulates your senses and has a great impact on your body and nervous system .
recent addi@@ tions include a healthy life , with an impact on your lifestyle .
it is a highly popular sport . furthermore , it provides a lot of benefits .
why not think about it ?
you &apos;ll find out that every time a rapid song comes up , you &apos;ll need to move even though you are sitting on a chair .
instead of sitting down , you should take on the actual challenge and have fun .
dancing is not intended for a special group of age , so everyone can start it .
the only advice would be to clear off the negative mood existing in your head , forget about the setbacks and just wind down .
as long as you enjoy yourself , you &apos;ll do excellent .
in conclusion , if you want a different kind of experience , go out and try .
the family is the most valuable and priceless gift that someone has ever had .
having a family means having everything .
the strong and special bond we have with our family is un@@ break@@ able , is that one powerful and magic connection that lasts forever .
friends come and go , but your family will always be there for you .
when you &apos;re at your worst , friends leave , they become strangers through the night and the next day they do n&apos;t even bother to say hello .
we will never know for sure how many of our friends are real ones and how many just fake a friendship , but there &apos;s one thing that we can be sure of : our family is our best friend .
friends ca n&apos;t always be relied on . they are willing to betray you and spread your darkest secrets around .
but you can count on your family &apos;s full support whenever you need it .
the family is where we grew up , where we were taught what love and kindness mean , the treasure that provided us with the warmth of a home .
we &apos;ll never go and ask a stranger for help . we &apos;ll go and ask for our mother or grandmother &apos;s wise advice , because it is a thousand times more valuable .
I believe that the infinite love that our family has for us is the most significant proof that we could never find a better best friend than our own family anywhere else throughout the world because since the day of our birth we were lucky enough to be given the best ones , our immediate family .
a lot of teenagers are jealous of famous people , assuming that their lives are amazing and full of entertainment , joy and fun .
but what about the price they have to pay for their outstanding lifestyle ?
no doubt , young people are sure that celebrities enjoy life , most of them only dream about it .
at the same time , they forget a very important thing .
film and pop stars , politicians , models , are sometimes deprived of their privacy .
more than hundreds of fans and paparazzi are hunting for them and even sometimes abuse their private environment .
being in public is the main part of their profession .
on the other hand , they have families of their own , close relatives , and they have the right to their personal pastime .
in my opinion , famous people deserve admiration due to their abilities and talents , though we should not only adore them , but respect them as well .
much has occured in the 20th century that has changed the way people live .
the invention that comes to mind as being the most influential is the computer .
this invention of the late 20th century has forever changed the way people live and work .
the first computers were expensive monsters that filled an entire room and could perform only a few calculations a second .
with the advancement in technology and the move toward mini@@ at@@ uri@@ zation , the desktop PC has evolved .
these small , relatively inexpensive machines can do everything their predecess@@ ors did and much more .
every day new and exciting improvements are being made to enhance the performance of these tools .
the impact of computers on the world has been great .
they have changed the way people do business and have radically altered the way data and information are dealt with .
in short , the productivity of people has increased ten - fold .
as we move into the 20th century , this fact will become more important .
the amount of information that is available in the world will require the use of computers to organize and extract that which is of interest .
the personal computer has , and will continue to play a major role in our lives .
the day is just around the corner when every human being in the developed world will have their own PC linked by cellular mode@@ m to the dat@@ ab@@ ases of the world , other PCs , and small digital assistants that will replace the printed page .
we have only just begun to realize the impact of this 20th century miracle .
we are limited only by our imaginations
and the future of this invention looks &quot; bright &quot; indeed .
the Ch@@ ere@@ po@@ ve@@ ts match factory &quot; F@@ ES@@ KO &quot; is the leading company in a match branch of industry .
it is the largest manufacturer of matches in the post - Soviet space and Europe .
at the same time , the company continues to grow , increasing production and strength@@ ening its position in the market .
the first try of the building The Ch@@ ere@@ po@@ vet@@ sk match factory was in 19@@ 48 , when the building of the factory on the beach of the river Y@@ ag@@ or@@ ba began .
but a set of equipment for the matches production was not received .
the building was developed into a pipe pl@@ ywood plant .
the match factory was built only in 1970 .
it was planned to buy equipment for the production in Sweden , but eventually the factory was equipped with domestic posi@@ tional equipment .
then the Ch@@ ere@@ po@@ vet@@ sk factory capacity was almost the worst in the industry .
general reconstruction of the company began in 1981 .
five &quot; Ar@@ enko &quot; automatic production lines were moun@@ ted during three years , and at the end of technology modernization 70% of the equipment has been replaced by brand - new ones .
and it was the beginning of as@@ cent into a leading position in the industry .
since 2012 , &quot; F@@ ES@@ KO &quot; has been caring for a large - scale modernization , which cost more than 200 million ru@@ bles .
fitness .
I would like to write about fitness because it &apos;s a very interesting topic for me because I live in a family where no one ever stops .
we usually do jogging . it &apos;s very healthy because the heart beat can improve if someone runs constantly at a low speed .
but I know that jogging is a sport that many people hate because it &apos;s tiring , so luckily there are infin@@ y sports and each of us can choose the best for him .
I find it very useful aerobic because it is based on physical exercise combined with music . it &apos;s very funny .
unfortunately most people do n&apos;t take physical exercise seriously because most people are lazy . anyway , I think that the exercises should be an integral part of our lives .
obviously , fitness also depends on diet .
the healthier you eat , the fitter you are .
that &apos;s a big advice but no one , including me , can give up on sweets .
normally , people go to a gym to feel and to look better .
when you feel good with yourself , you enjoy life more and you even have more protection against illness .
in fact , it &apos;s for this reason that I extend the hours of physical education at school .
sport helps not only the body but also the mind . it helps to vent the nerves and it makes you free .
do it for yourself . at the beginning it will be hard but at the end you &apos;ll be satisfied .
during my time as a teacher , I used to organise many group activities .
an example that I would like to provide was during my in@@ duction year , when I had to select and organise a group of students to represent the school in a charity campaign .
when I was selecting the group , I had to take into account each student &apos;s background and motivations in order to have mixed and cooperative learning .
I used my good communication skills to explain what was necessary to accomplish the task and also , to deliver instruc@@ tional materials .
I used plenty of positive reinfor@@ cement to encourage everyone to participate , because they were a low ability group with low levels of motivation , and they were not used to winning in any challenge .
whilst the students were producing artwork to sell in order to raise funds , I used to supervise and monitor tasks giving feedback about the accomplished ones and how they could improve them .
the campaign was a success , and the group was awarded the prize of the most solidarity students within the national context .
to begin with , obviously everybody has a right to his or her own privacy .
there is no doubt that nobody wants to be stal@@ ked - it is uncomfortable and annoying .
even a star wants to have a little piece of quiet from time to time .
surely a journalist or a paparazzi can be wrong in making their judgments .
it does n&apos;t matter if someone is a celebrity or an ordinary human being - I believe misleading gossip can ruin anyone &apos;s life .
on the other hand , sometimes big stars would n&apos;t be so famous if they were n&apos;t chased by some paparazzi .
as a matter of fact , it appears that some people want to be followed on purpose - to gain more fame of course .
a bad reputation often seems to be the shortest way to bathe in glory .
also journalists deserve to earn a living and make good stories for their editors , especially if it is an exclusive event .
finally , a lack of privacy is an unpleasant price for staying in the li@@ me@@ light .
famous people are forced to live with it whether they like it or not .
I agree that celebrities should n&apos;t be constantly followed by journalists but if they truly wanted their privacy to be respected , they would n&apos;t be involved in so many public scandals - there are people who just love getting others &apos; attention .
the diagram exhibit the changes during the last ten years in the quantities of immigrants to Australia .
it is separated into nine world regions .
the ones that show significant decrease are Europe and Asia .
moreover , India , East and America have only a very small decrease .

however , the regions of Oceania and Africa really increased .
overall , the chart shows that there has been a decrease in immigration .
nowadays there are a lot of famous people in our society who are facing the lack of privacy .@@ In my opinion , they deserve to have as much privacy as possible .
they are ordinary people with the same needs as everybody else .
however , as they are famous , they receive a lot more attention from the media and fans than we could imagine .
the un@@ stop@@ able vast amount of attention is usually worse thing than good .
everybody wishes to have as much privacy as possible .
it is unbearable for famous people to deal with journalists when they go shopping or anywhere else .
can you imagine yourself going shopping and having a group of journalists taking a picture of every step you take ?
I can guarantee that none of us would appreciate a lifestyle like that .
I can firmly say that famous people like politicians and film@@ stars deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
students finished school at the age of 16 .
they are very young but I believe that young people should have the chance to go their own way .
in my opinion , it is a good experience for young people to leave school at the age of 16 because they
have the chance to get practical experience .
people tend to look to the black side .
I think there are two good reasons for going to work at the age of 16 .
firstly ,
because they are young and motivated and some students are glad to finish studying .
secondly , it is so important to learn as much as you can when you are young .
on the other hand , they are not old enough to know what they want to do their whole lives .
I think it is hard to get prepared for real life .
teachers do their best
but is it enough ?
however , the system is working and it would be hard to improve it .
everybody has the opportunity to make his own decision .
nowadays , more and more people tend to have a healthy lifestyle .
everybody wants to be healthy and to visit his doctor only once per year for health evaluation .
however , living a healthy life style is not easy , it requires following next steps , such as eating a healthy diet , exercising regularly , and getting enough sleep at night .
physical activity is one of the most important aspects of a healthy lifestyle .
regular exercise not only keeps your body physically strong , but also reduces the likelihood of getting many health related problems and increases tolerance for stressful situations .
it is a fact that physical exercise makes our ske@@ le@@ ton - muscle system stronger .
well - developed and strong ver@@ te@@ br@@ al muscles keep our body in the right vertical position , so ver@@ te@@ br@@ al de@@ formation will not develop and back pain will not occur .
indeed , doing a special type of gym activity called &quot; cardi@@ o &quot; improves blood circulation in internal organs and in the heart .
accordingly , risk of cardi@@ o - v@@ ascular diseases decreases .
also , everybody knows that strong positive or negative emotions , due to certain hormon@@ al reactions , have an impact on a heart work .
in a regular person , a heart rate and blood pressure can increase dramatically and even cause a stroke or a heart attack .
in trained people will increase intention of heart contrac@@ tions and stroke volume .
the heart rate will be changed slightly .
thus , trained people have better tolerance of stressful situations .
food that we consume is the next issue of a healthy lifestyle .
a healthy diet consists of balanced , fresh , and un@@ processed food with proper amount of calories .
our daily food should include enough protein , carbohydrates , fat , minerals , and vitamins which are required for normal body functions .
for instance , luck of protein causes muscle weakness ; luck of the vitamin A causes my@@ opia and evening blind@@ ness .
also , if food is not fresh or prepared not properly , it can consist of bacteria or paras@@ ites .
for example , spoiled milk products can lead to gastr@@ o - inte@@ stin@@ al track dys@@ functions , and not properly thermal processing seafood can cause le@@ p@@ tos@@ pir@@ osis .
moreover , fast - food should not be on the table .
avoiding eating fast - food products , we diminish a risk factor for getting some serious disease , such as cancer .
French fries are only one example .
fries are usually cooked in a large amount of oil which boils all day .
in addition , we have to limit the size of portions and consume only a small amount of calories according to our individual needs .
in this way we will never have problems with obesity .
being Heal@@ thy is fun !
you may think being unhealthy is only being fat but that &apos;s not true .
being unhealthy leads to multiple diseases such as heart or breathing problems and even depression .
besides this being very aw@@ full , staying healthy is a good way to feel good with yourself , find new interests and new friends .
here are some suggestions for you who want to be healthy :
• In@@ stead of going to a fast food chain in your lunchtime why do n&apos;t you try to go to our cafeteria in the campus , which has a whole variety of salads and soups that are not only healthy but also really tasty ?
• Did you know that our athletics team is accepting regi@@ str@@ ations ?
this could be a great way to find new teammates that would help you develop some skills .
do n&apos;t waste time , run to go get the last spots .
• Right outside our campus you can find a gym that offers a lot of activities , such as spinning , aerobics or even swimming lessons .
also , because you are studying in this college they will give you a big discount !
• Are you what is called a couch potato ? get out of the couch , hang up the TV and go to the park in the campus .
there you can breathe some fresh air while you read a book , play fri@@ sbee or defend your point of view with other students .
traveling by car has become more and more popular nowadays .
however , public transport will still survive .
first of all , public transport like buses and subways are much cheaper and less resource consuming than cars .
public transport can provide an affordable option for those who can not afford to buy fancy cars .
it &apos;s also more convenient to travel by public transport like airplanes for a long distance since traveling by car for a long distance can be really exhausting and inconvenient .
last but not the least , public transport is more environmentally friendly than cars , which means public transport will be playing an even more important role when the environmental problem becomes more and more severe .
if I could dream about imaginary transport , the machine would be long , wide and white .
I must be laying inside it to travel and the most important thing is that I &apos;ll fall completely asleep in a few seconds .
I will be awake again when I arrive until my destiny : the Spanish Golden Century .
there the dr@@ am@@ atur@@ ge L@@ ope de Vega will be waiting for me to show me how plays take place in that period of time when the te@@ a@@ thr@@ e was the best entertainment and the buildings were great .
maybe , I &apos;ll act like I did in the past .
now I &apos;m going to write a movie review .
the name of the film is Bang@@ al@@ ore days .
it is a film by An@@ j@@ ali Men@@ on who directed the film U@@ sta@@ ad hotel earlier .
it is a tale of three childhood friends from K@@ er@@ ala .
Ku@@ tt@@ an , Kun@@ ju@@ (@@ Di@@ vi@@ ya ) and Ar@@ jun .
they are typical small town young dreaming of the big city Bang@@ al@@ ore .
Ku@@ tt@@ an himself narr@@ ated the story .
he starts with a punch line when they are in K@@ er@@ ala . they do n&apos;t like it , but when they are out of K@@ er@@ ala they miss it so much .
at the beginning of the story Ku@@ tt@@ an got a job in Bang@@ al@@ ore besides Di@@ v@@ ya completed her BB@@ A from a local college .
she is planning to go to a bigger city for MBA .
at that moment an ast@@ ro@@ lo@@ ger recommended Di@@ v@@ ya to marry soon .
so a arranged marriage happens .
her husband &apos;s name is D@@ as .
when d@@ as first met Di@@ v@@ ya , he told her that he had a serious relationship and he did n&apos;t think he was over it .
but it did not hamper the marriage .
from the first night div@@ ya of the marriage Di@@ v@@ ya found something very wrong when d@@ as put off all his wedding clothes and come up with sleeping g@@ own with a laptop in addition said that he has some office work to do .
when they go to their apartment in Bang@@ al@@ ore showing a room d@@ as said that the room remains locked with old stuffs hence they can use other rooms .
d@@ as keeps himself busy with office work all the time besides he is showing an attitude that he has no time for others .
though Di@@ v@@ ya and he is a married couple , he has never shown any interest in Di@@ v@@ ya .
at the beginning div@@ ya always tried to match with d@@ as but she could not .
so she is losing patience and grows a damn care attitude .
d@@ as never feels for Di@@ v@@ ya .
so she keeps herself busy with her friends .
meanwhile , Ar@@ jun comes to the city . as he is a motor cycle expert , he found a racing club named storm riders and starts work as a motor mechanic .
he can ride motor bike exceptionally well h@@ ence@@ forward he won a race with the club owner .
later the club owner banned him for one year .
but the coach of the club keeps an eye on him .
meanwhile Ar@@ jun falls in love with an r@@ j named sar@@ ah who is disabled .
the relationship faces many odds .
Sarah &apos;s mother does n&apos;t approve of the relationship .
they want to go Australia .
the relationship between Di@@ v@@ ya and D@@ as is getting worse .
at this time , after a quarrel div@@ ya opened the locked room and found that room is kee@@ p@@ sake of d@@ as &apos;s past relationship .
now div@@ ya understand why their relationship is not working .
then she discussed it with her two best friends Ar@@ jun and K@@ ut@@ ty .
these two became very angry .
later Di@@ v@@ ya goes back to his parents &apos; home .
her family blamed d@@ as and his family and wanted a divorce .
Ku@@ tt@@ an wants to marry a girl who must be a traditional K@@ er@@ al@@ alian and has respect for K@@ er@@ al@@ ai@@ an culture moreover the need to be beautiful .
at this point Ku@@ tt@@ an made an urgent air trip to visit his sick father .
on the plane he met Me@@ en@@ ak@@ shi , the flight attendant .
when Ku@@ tt@@ an saw Me@@ en@@ ak@@ shi he thought he had found his dream girl .
later they met in a mall and suddenly at that time they exchanged their phone numbers .
the relationship began to grow .
latter he found Me@@ en@@ ak@@ shi is not a traditional girl rather is a tri@@ ck@@ ster .
it broke his heart .
eventually he found Indian tradi@@ tion@@ alism in a foreign girl .
one day when the yearly racing event comes , the coach tries to manage Ar@@ jun to attend the race .
at this time Ar@@ jun found out D@@ as was the racing legend of the club .
everybody respects and loves d@@ as .
he gets to know the story of d@@ as from others .
after a terrible accident , D@@ as &apos;s girlfriend dies .
after that no one sees d@@ as . Ar@@ jun share the thing with his friends .
Di@@ v@@ ya immediately back to Bang@@ al@@ ore and starts her MBA .
now the d@@ as and Di@@ v@@ ya are coming closer .
in the race , Ar@@ jun becomes champion .
on the same day Sarah is leaving for Australia .
after the race d@@ as drove them to Sarah &apos;s home to halt her .
thus the story finished happily .
I love playing tennis .
I think it is one of the most complete sports in the world .
I started playing tennis when I was 10 years old . my father taught me first and then I had one of the best teachers in the country .
I was a great player , I won several tournaments and I had a lot of fans .
my game was based on resistance . I could play for hours , I had just one thing in my head , pass the ball no matter what .
my height was an important advantage too . I could reach all the balls from one corner to another .
when I talk with kids who want to start playing tennis , I always tell them tennis is about const@@ ancy . it &apos;s not easy . you ca n&apos;t watch a game on TV and try to play just like them in a couple of days . it does n&apos;t work that way .
you must train at least two hours per day , eat proper food , have no alcohol and sleep enough .
if you can do that , you are a future tennis champion .
good luck .
throughout my entire life , technological breakthroughs da@@ zzled me .
in school , I indulged passionately in my study , trying to understand how electrical gadgets work .
on roads , I observed cars , wondering how they moved .
I enjoyed using technical devices and electrical gadgets even in bed .
however , when I was a teenager , my mother had to go through a surgical operation to remove part of her liver .
this type of surgery has a low mortality risk due to the likelihood of human error .
although , the operation was successful and my mother was healthy again .
the doctor had to remove her ov@@ aries during the surgery after he managed to accidentally cause a hemorr@@ ha@@ ge in them .
he made a human mistake and my mother barely survived her liver operation with the un@@ announced removal of her ov@@ aries .
the overwhelming panic that I felt during her operation and the pain we went through as a family after her surgery has changed the shape of my life forever .
due to a human mistake , neither my life nor my mother &apos;s life was ever the same again .
ever since that day , I wanted to be an engineer to design a robotic system that can perform surgeries with high accuracy ; thus , eliminating the human error margin .
I studied me@@ chat@@ r@@ onics engineering with the hope that one day , with enough knowledge and willpower , I will be able to work and contribute to the field of engineering .
I am both hardworking and resi@@ li@@ ent .
living in my city Ale@@ ppo , located in Syria , during the war has broad@@ ened my vision and expanded my horizons .
I want to contribute to the improvement of my country and fixing what the war has broken by providing inexpensive pros@@ thesis for the injured victims of war .
therefore , master &apos;s studies would enable me to put a smile on a child &apos;s face who might have lost his legs , but this does not necessarily mean he has lost his right to play and enjoy his childhood .
I believe in life - long learning and I am enthusiastic about learning European languages in general , and German , in particular .
after finishing my master &apos;s program , I will be preparing for my Ph.D. B@@ esi@@ des studying in academic settings , I will continue learning and improving my German language while getting around Germany in my free time to learn about its en@@ ticing and wonderful culture .
I believe that we , as humans , are all equal and we all have the same dreams and hopes .
thus , I want to do my best to help every life on planet Earth to lead a healthy and happy life .
not just the present generation , but also the entire human race .
I think that after at@@ taining enough knowledge in the technical field , I will be able to extend the life expectancy of the human race with robots and systems that can work hand in hand to ensure humans &apos; safety .
whether by designing more intelligent systems to organize traffic or developing robots that can conduct surgeries with lower risk .
finally , I have to say that I feel the urge to help every human being that I come across in my life regardless of their race , gender or eth@@ nic@@ ity . I do think that we have inside us all the power to achieve our dreams in life ; we just need a strong motive and enough dedication .
the sky is the limit .
the computer has been a major , technological invention of great importance .
we are able to perform tasks such as writing letters at the push of a button , using programs and even playing games with these masterpieces .
a person of any age can use a computer for business or pleasure and generally , the machine is a super enhancement in our ever - expanding , business - ori@@ ent@@ ated world .
with health experts , however , our marvellous machine provokes problems for our health which must not be ignored .
apart from being a necessity to some , it makes the human being lazy to a certain extent and thus , allows us to use our brains even less and less .
it is true to say that a computer is able to perform many hundreds of useful tasks which our brains are completely indifferent to .
but we ought to ask ourselves &quot; What happens when the computer - ori@@ ent@@ ated world collap@@ ses ?
&quot; we would then have to use our brains .
it is not sensible to put all our efforts and hopes into a machine which runs off electricity .
the brain must be exercised to allow for this possible cl@@ anger , if we are d@@ is - connected from our precious computers .
we must educate ourselves more and our children especially , who are at the fore@@ front of tomorrow &apos;s technology .
Hello Jo .
in my opinion , my country , Spain , is the best place to travel .
here you can find a lot of wonderful cities and many places to visit .
I would like to recommend you two cities to visit .
firstly , you must visit Sevilla .
Sevilla is in the south of Spain .
it is a large city .
it has a hot climate .
people there are very happy and they celebrate their parties in the street .
it is very important to stay there in Spring .
secondly To@@ le@@ do .
To@@ le@@ do is in the centre of Spain .
it is a historical city .
To@@ le@@ do was built in a mountain that has a river around it .
To@@ le@@ do was a place where there were three cultures .
it has an important historical centre , with many museums and places to visit .
here in Spain it is very easy to work if you want .
although there are many people without a job , it is known there are many temporary jobs to work in .
in summer bars and restaurants need many waiters and coo@@ kers .
these employees are tempor@@ al , you can get some money for your trip .
warm regards .
Rafa .
dear Prime Editor , Recently , a significant number of local people have been arguing about building the recycling plant .
like many others , I strongly believe it will involve several positive aspects to everyone .
in fact , almost all the residents in our local area are inclined to believe that building such a huge recycling plant will provide jobs which we need .
also , our neighbourhood used to be one of the most attractive areas , but now there is an unbe@@ ar@@ ably enormous increase in the amount of garbage which we want to get rid of .
another reason , protecting the environment has been very difficult to do , but by building the recycling plant it will be much easier to keep our environment well .
recycling does not only save the environment but also save your money , as buying recycled items is a lot cheaper .
the government has a massive responsibility to enth@@ use people to recycle .
finally , in my opinion building the recycling plant is a great idea .
f@@ actually , it is beneficial to both humans and the environment . yours faithfully , Ban@@ hi Mohamed
dear Tom ,
I write to you to apply for this job in the summer@@ camp . I usually work with children of this age because I &apos;m a teacher and when I finish , every day I usually go to prepare food for a lot of children of the same school .
in my free time , I like preparing activities for children that are normally related to sports and evening activities .
I &apos;m could be considered an energetic and cheerful person . I put all my energy into the work that I do . I &apos;m a hardworking person .
if I have anything to do I always win .
I &apos;m interested in this job because I like to learn and improve my experience at work and my curriculum .
I think that I will be a suitable person for the job because I have all that you need of a person .
thanks for your consideration .
bye .
if ever there was a false statement it is ; &quot; There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient . &quot;
travelling by car with its carbon mon@@ oxide poisoning the atmosphere and creating global climate change .
it is killing the planet .
our love of convenience will cause the end of our beautiful planet and so , of course , us as well .
in most large cities around the world , now cars are actually inconvenient and most people rely on public transport to get around .
the Paris Metro , New York Subway and London Under@@ ground are all an integral part of these te@@ aming cities .
in many cities there are not only massive traffic jams but there is no where to park your car once you get to your destination .
if there is to be a public transport they will need to use and enjoy public transportation .
the model does need some work , however , such as smaller and more frequent buses during most of the day , with the big buses only coming out during the rush hours .
the future is all about public transport , with the private gas driven car a thing of the past .
if we make it past this disaster we will be saying &quot; What were we thinking ? &quot; .
television has become an important part of our daily life , and it has both advantages as well as disadvantages .
nowadays , television is not only a source of entertainment and advertisements but also an impressive teaching aid of education . its educational importance ca n&apos;t be underestimated as well .
it is becoming popular in schools . also , its audio - visual quality makes education programmes more effective and interesting .
hence schools are making use of its potential for importing education .
most schools in the United States of America have television sets . a lesson in the classroom is often boring , and it does not appeal to most of the students , so they do not attend it .
to create interest in lessons , television is a good resource .
in subjects like science and geography , there are many things which can be shown on television .
Hi , na@@ z@@ an@@ in !
thank you for the postcard .
it was very nice of you .
how were your Easter holidays ?
my holidays were rather interesting , even extraordinary .
as you know , this year I had celebrated Easter in Germany , because the Easter vacations were very short .
so , I tried to celebrate Easter according to my uk@@ rain@@ ian folk@@ laws .
traditionally in the morning we have E@@ aster@@ mess in the church , and then E@@ aster@@ breakfast .
before the mess , you must prepare a basket that contains traditional Easter food and bless it in this Easter mess .
it was not so easy to find all the foods ...
but , at least Easter came .
the weather was amazing . it was warm and sunny , in spite of the day before , it was cold , windy and ha@@ zy .
I and my two friends went to the railway station , because the mess took place in Er@@ <eos> .
it was funny to take the basket though the town , because it was windy and I had to carry the basket very attentive not to leave the nap@@ kin .
the mess had to start at 3 , but it started almost at 4 .
the mess lasted approximately 2 and a half hours and then we expected to get home fast , because we were rather hungry .
but it was a little surprise for us ...
we made only a few steps , and suddenly it became hail .
in a few minutes it looked like it &apos;s winter outdoors .
it was not so easy to get to the railway station , because it rained and ha@@ iled and we did n&apos;t have any umbrella at all .
so , we missed one train and had to wait for another near one hour .
we got home only near 8 , we were very hungry and at least we had our E@@ aster@@ supper .
we had a great time together .
the next day my friends came to me for a visit .
so it was really cool .
hope my story was not too long . )
have you already planned anything for the next weekend ?
we could go anywhere together .
I &apos;m waiting for your answer .
from : Mer@@ c@@ è
to : Marta
subject : your family
Hi Marta ,
I &apos;m writing because I want to invite you and your family this summer to Men@@ or@@ ca .
I think that you can come in the first week of July .
you can stay in my home in the countryside .
when you go we can go to the beach in the morning and we can take a walk from Ci@@ ut@@ ad@@ ella in the evening . do n&apos;t worry if you do n&apos;t want to spend a lot of money because we can have lunch at dinner at home .
I &apos;m speaking with my daughter .
she is very happy because she wants to play tennis with her son .
hope to see you soon !

we are suffering a great economic crisis in Spain .
there is high inflation and a large underground economy . as a result , the education system of our country takes place among the poor@@ est in Europe , together with the United States and the UK .
the economic crisis is affecting principally education .
politics is cutting back the aids to study .
there are more and more students that ca n&apos;t study because they receive little economic help .
one solution to solve this problem is to cut down on the salaries of people like footballers , politics , and comment@@ ators of tra@@ shy TV like Sal@@ v@@ ame .
society is sure that if they do this , we , the students , will get enough money to study .
the authorities have been working really hard to find a way to take care of the environment in the community .
they have a program in that programme . the first rule is one day per month all neighbors go out to clean every street .
people have to separate the garbage organic or inorganic , if people do n&apos;t do it .
they have kept the garbage in their house still . they follow the rules .
people aboard garbage trucks do n&apos;t receive garbage .
this line graph shows the number of visitors to a selection of some different museums and galleries in shar@@ j@@ ah . overall , the greatest number of visitors was in shar@@ j@@ ah museum of is@@ lam@@ ic civilisation and the least number of visitors was for Mar@@ aya art centre .
the most noticeable aspect of data in sar@@ j@@ ah art museum that it started in 1991 and increased slightly until 2001 . then it rose sharply to reach a peak of approxim@@ atly 3.@@ 2 in 2006 . secondly , if we look at Shar@@ j@@ ah calligraphy museum and Shar@@ j@@ ah arche@@ ology museum , we can notice that both lines started in the same year 1991 . arche@@ ology museum started with a number of 0.@@ 3 . then it remained steady until 2001 , then it increased sharply and the calligraphy museum started with 1 million visitors and decreased slightly .
nowadays , public transport seems to be one of the most suitable choices for us to travel .
this may be regarded as a quite difficult problem to solve .
more and more families are now getting used to buying individual cars rather than using public transport .
on the one hand , for our daily lives , it is worth buying a car .
we can use it for a wide range of activities such as taking our children to school , going to our place of work , doing the shopping and , of course , going on family vacations .
prices might seem more expensive at first , but later on , cars tend to turn very affordable .
but on the other hand , the climate change is ahead of us . we must ensure that every single person contributes to making our environment a better place for future generations .
for instance , we have many examples to prove that public transport itself is improving our environment .
London &apos;s subway , for example , carries more than one thousand people each day .
people barely use their cars in crowded cities . that is why public transport still has a unique role in our daily lives .
furthermore , public transport is developing new environmental friendly engines that may provide better conditions and renewed air for our people .
investing in this sort of transport is now becoming a traditional activity for those who have enough income to care about society .
to sum up , people will still be using public transport in the future , although new changes must be made looking forward to surviving .
first of all , try to organize your sport and music time and try your best to do both .
if you &apos;re convinced you can not do both of them , think about two things . first , about which activity you will have a better future . and second , which one of these activities you like the most . in my opinion ,
I think sport will give you a lot of benefits more than music , because you do what you like and , at the same time , exercise .
I really hope this helps you .
sincerely H@@ ector
many people believe that being famous is fantastic . everyone on the street wants to get a picture of you . you have many fans .
being popular is cool because everyone knows you .
another good thing about it is that you &apos;re distingui@@ shable .
on the other hand , all the time you &apos;re observed by cameras , paparazzi , fans , even if you &apos;re at home , on holiday with your family .
you ca n&apos;t even go shopping without being noticed .
and I &apos;m sure that next day your photo will be on the first page of daily news .
what &apos;s more , journalists are just waiting for your mistake , inaccurate statements or com@@ promising behaviour .
moreover , politicians are especially exposed to being even attacked by br@@ azen journalists who hunt for them .
in my opinion , famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them .
nowadays , everyone wants to know what a private idol &apos;s life looks like , so I think it &apos;s very hard for famous people to save their own life for themselves .
nowadays , everything in the world is developing , such as education , transport , people &apos;s lives and so on .
I &apos;m sure that in the future these will develop more .
in the future , education will grow a lot . I think it will change about how to teach and what to learn .
scientists will create a pen that can write in space . with this pen , teachers do n&apos;t want to go to the place they have board but also write when they want everywhere . and a device which helps students ca n&apos;t go to school can include lessons and , with this device , they can discuss with their friends in a comfortable way .
about the transport in the next 50 years , cars that use the sun &apos;s energy will be popular , and cars that cause the environment to become pollution will be gone away .
the number of people walking to school or the place where they work will increase .
this is a good change .
people &apos;s lives will change , too . in this time , maybe each family will have a robot which does housework .
people do n&apos;t want to spend a lot of time on housework and instead , they can relax after work or do some different activities .
people &apos;s lifestyles will be more comfortable .
I reflect there are many changes in the future .
all about me
Hello , I &apos;m A@@ il@@ sa Da@@ el L@@ am and I &apos;m thirteen years old .
I was born in the Netherlands in a town called U@@ tre@@ cht .
it is a nice town in the center of the Netherlands .
some people think I was born in Holland , but that is not right .
I was born in the Netherlands .
Holland is a place in the west of the Netherlands .
Amsterdam , the capital of the country , is there too .
about two years before I was born , my sister J@@ ette came to the world .
she is now fifteen years old .
I also have a father called Ge@@ urt , it is a Dutch name which is hard to say for Swedish people , and a mother called Wil@@ le@@ mi@@ en .
we always had animals in our family .
Fred was the first cat I ever had .
he was always in my bed when I was a baby .
he had a special voice .
it was loud and everyone knew who he was because of it .
but now he is dead .
he died when he was eighteen years old .
today we have a dog , Sil@@ as , and two other cats called Sel@@ ma en Romeo .
when Sel@@ ma was one year old she had five kittens .
one of them was Romeo .
today they are not so nice to each other as when they were smaller .
I moved to Sweden ten years ago .
we moved because of the nature and because we wanted adventure .
in the Netherlands there is n&apos;t so much nature .
when we moved to Sweden I felt how the air was cleaner .
we rented a house near the water .
after a few years , we moved to the house where we still live today on Ed@@ s@@ vi@@ k@@ s@@ v@@ ä@@ gen 1@@ 18 in Danderyd .
we did n&apos;t move so far , but to a bigger and much nicer house .
every Wednesday before I go to my dance class I go to the Dutch school .
there I learn things about Dutch gramma@@ ti@@ ca so that I &apos;m on the same level as the Dutch children of my age .
if I want to , I can study in the Netherlands because of this .
I like to dance and to play field hockey .
I play field hockey on Sundays and I dance on Wednesdays and Saturdays .
most Swe@@ des do n&apos;t know what field hockey is , but it is a sport much like ban@@ dy . the difference is that the stick is n&apos;t the same .
I feel happy and free when I play hockey and dance .
I like to do sport but I definitely like animals too .
last summer I was in Spain with my cousins . it was the best holiday ever .
we lived on a campsite near the sea .
there I made my first scuba dive .
it was so funny .
when I slowly sank down into the water I heard the sound of bubbles .
I saw three red sea stars and many fishes .
I would really want to dive in Australia some day .
I also swam a lot with my cousins .
one of my favorite memories is when Sel@@ ma got five kittens .
it was so nice to play with them and they were so cute .
she got them one night in May@@ . I heard the sound of a cat and woke up .
when I looked to my left side I saw Sel@@ ma in a basket , but she was n&apos;t alone .
there were a few other kittens in the basket !
I called them Romeo , Re@@ bec@@ ka , Su@@ chi , Ron@@ ja and Viggo .
all of them were white with black spots except one , Ron@@ ja , she was black with a white stomach .
my favorite restaurant is Bon@@ bon in Stockholm .
there they have small dishes with fish , meat or vegetables .
when you want one of the small dishes they put a small ball in a glass .
when you have to pay they look at how many balls there are in the glass and then they count how many you have to pay .
it &apos;s very nice there and you do n&apos;t have to choose one dish , you can eat more smaller dishes .
I also like Italian food in restaurants like Ci@@ ao Ci@@ ao Du@@ o in Stockholm .
when I &apos;m a grown up I want to be a veter@@ inary .
that &apos;s because I love animals and I want to help them when they are sick .
I think many arians arians ask too much money for something that you can do at home too .
I do n&apos;t want to be like that and I want to start my own animal hospital .
my favorite color is blue .
it &apos;s not just one sort of blue , but all sorts of it .
I also like pink .
I have much more favorite books than colors .
I like the Hunger Games really much , but I also like books by John Boy@@ ne like The Boy in the stri@@ ped pyjamas .
I also like the book this is Mal@@ ala and The kite runner of Khal@@ ed Hos@@ sa@@ in .
I like to read books about war and the T@@ ali@@ ban , because I think it is interesting and exciting .
these stories are often very sad too , and I like to read that sort of story .
that was a little about myself .
thank you for listening .

the recent developments in the field of genetic engineering have come largely as a result of discoveries made and techniques designed during this century , starting with the discovery of DNA and the m@@ apping and understanding of its structure .
the manipulation of genes is an incre@@ adi@@ bly important and dangerously powerful ability which can not be left simply to the scientists to look after .
we are all now affected by the results of genetic engineering be it for medical reasons or commercial ones .
tomatoes are designed and engine@@ ered to last longer , apples to grow bigger , crops to ri@@ pen late to allow for transport time , pigs used to grow insulin for human use ...
the list is enormous .
along with the many advantages , there are dangers .
new biological weapons are being developed all over the world , eg the ability to transfer the genes which cause cancer into a simple disease such as the common cold , could , without much doubt , wipe out a significant percentage of the human race .
there need not be a war for something disastrous like this to occur . these genetically engine@@ ered mic@@ rob@@ es could be released accidentally whilst being investigated in an un@@ sealed laboratory .
if we are going to accept the advantages which come with genetic engineering we also have to take responsibility for the disadvantages . the sta@@ kes are too high to leave this job to the scientists and they ca n&apos;t be expected to take the moral responsibility of people who misuse discoveries / inventions thereby causing disaster .
governments should in@@ sure that money is invested not only in the research of genetic engineering , but also in in@@ <eos> that the results of this research are kept safe .
I recommend visiting Guido mine .
it &apos;s an old mine , which was changed into a culture zone in our city .
of course , it &apos;s still a mine , so you can see all the minor equipment used - Z@@ ab@@ r@@ ze is located in Sile@@ sia , the area of coal mine .
it was set in 18@@ 55 by Guido H@@ enc@@ kel v@@ on Don@@ ner@@ smar@@ ck , so the mine was named .
it has such a rich history , so I ca n&apos;t just tell you everything in one e - mail .
I can say only that , the mine is divided into two levels : 170 and 3@@ 20 .
the first one , level 170 , presents methods of mining , work of miners in late 19th century and history of that industry in Sile@@ sia .
this level is made up of interactive forms of sightseeing supported by lights and sounds .
the main assumption is to shock visitor and make him feel and , in my opinion , it surely does .
the visitors may be surprised by noise of cr@@ ack@@ ling cel@@ ing or rats &apos; squ@@ eling .
there are also many exhibitions organised all year round .
a high - quality guide is waiting for every group of visitors and he &apos;s ready for even the most serious av@@ al@@ an@@ che of questions .
on the path of sightseeing you can also find a chapel - place which is very important for every minor and , of course , the place where the important celebrations take place .
on level 3@@ 20 , which resembles a real mine , you can see a long@@ wall coal - cutting machine while it &apos;s working .
you can also touch real coal with your hands .
there are organised many concerts , exhibitions and theatre plays too .
and if you get hungry - you can try something regional - you may be sure that cooks do n&apos;t let you starve to death .
I think that Guido mine is well worth visiting .
love ,
XYZ .
nowadays , the aeroplane is treated as an ordinary aspect of our life .
its chief purpose is to transfer people safely from one place to another .
however , a few decades ago we had a very limited notion of such a technology .
yet , in the present , so ubiquitous it is that we seem not to take notice of air business .
if one were to del@@ ve into the most paramount inventions of the last century , they would probably indicate modern conveniences , namely television or the computer .
we tend to under@@ rate the importance of Aer@@ op@@ lane .
it is clearly obvious that air travel has had an enormous impact on the way we conc@@ eive the world .
firstly , as a result of its development we can experience a noticeable soar in mass tourism .
people have ample opportunities to set off on a ri@@ ve@@ ting journey to places they previously imagined while reading an adventurous book .
besides , the great influence of the Aer@@ op@@ lane may be seen in mass e@@ migration .
had it not been for Wright brothers e@@ migrants and casualties would not have been able to settle in remote lands , hence the world would tee@@ ter financially .
as far as vast changes which the aeroplane has undergone are concerned , society &apos;s attitude has also improved .
in the first place , throughout decades we had distant relations with such initially fal@@ li@@ ble a work@@ horse .
a classic illustration of this could be the use of air machines only for martial purposes .
since the 20th century was about wars , we would only kill and ex@@ termin@@ ate people .
additionally , creating such a vehicle was our mor@@ bid fascination since the time im@@ memorial .
nonetheless , the situation has somewhat norm@@ alised .
air travel has converted from luxury at the rich &apos;s disposal to a common thing available for almost everyone .
I personally believe that the influence which the aeroplane has had on our life is significant , yet we have to bear in mind dangers connected with it .
for instance , at the beginning of the 21st century tourists have been under the constant threat of terrorists .
moreover , the opportunities which air technology brings may easily contribute to further development .
perhaps , it will improve to such an extent that commuting from Tokyo to London would be in the twin@@ kling of an eye .
to sum up , air business and its changes have been important for the world .
apart from minute drawbacks , we can only lau@@ d its benefits .
it has certainly had an edi@@ fying effect on our thinking of travelling .
many years ago , people lived without all the things we have nowadays , such as mobile phones , LED TVs , computers , etc .
this means that we have experim@@ ented on an important change with the passing of time . it is due to the rise of technology , and it entails that people &apos;s lives change .
now , will we continue developing our technology and our life ?
from my point of view , technology will continue changing our life in aspects of routine , free time , up to the point that we will not be able to live without using them .
it is a problem , we must not depend on items like phones , TVs , and all items created by technology .
if we had to live in the past , bearing in mind all our dependency on technology , we would not be able to live in this way , I am sure of it .
nonetheless , I think that people &apos;s lives will improve thanks to technology , not only by referring to bad things like the dependency of technology , it offers us interesting things like new technologies , new informatics systems in order to improve the world of job , improvement in a wide range of job sectors , agriculture , healthy system , etc .
finally , in order to sum up , I think that people &apos;s lives will change , but not dramatically . it depends on each person and the way in which people focus their lives .
unfortunately I haven&apos;t seen any tri@@ ll@@ ers for ages .
I prefer other genres .
I saw a really great comedy by W@@ es Anderson last month .
its title is The Hotel Grand Budapest .
the story took place in Eastern Europe between the two world wars .
the hotel manager used to take care of his regular clients , especially old ladies .
the hotel fl@@ ori@@ shed and the manager felt himself and behaved like a God in his small universe .
he hired the aged aged Indian refuge@@ e as a bell@@ boy and taught him all his skills .
he gave the boy a lot of hospitality , friendship , courage and humanity .
an old man came back to the place of his youth and told the story about his friend and master .
nowadays , public transport is less convenient than travelling by car because there are other solutions , like the Internet , which is about sharing a car for a relatively low price with people that are going to go to the same destination .
sharing a car could be an alternative to saving money , but also it is more comfortable than travelling with a lot of people .
first of all , public transport has fewer routes ; it is too difficult to travel , for example , if you had to work at <eos> ne hours and on special days it is impossible to catch a seat .
on the other hand , if you have lost the bus , train or any other public transport , you have to wait a long time between them and that results in mad@@ dering .
in conclusion , people prefer travelling by car because it is more comfortable , you can go everywhere you want at the time you consider the best and choose to share the space with other people or not .
nowadays , people spend lots of money in order to go to an English speaking country to improve their language skills .
but is it really the most effective way of learning a language ?
from my point of view , studying in a foreign country has certain drawbacks .
firstly , this way is very expensive as the tuition fee for overseas students is rather high .
besides , when you study abroad , you have to adapt to a very different way of life , which can be quite stressful .
what is more , English teachers do not speak Russian so if you do n&apos;t know English well , you will not understand their explanation .
it is often assumed that it is better to study a language abroad because you can always use it when speaking with native speakers .
however , I doubt that we will have lots of opportunities to speak abroad as we do not know many people there .
it is also believed that Russian teachers are not as qualified as those in England .
I totally disagree with this opinion because Russian teachers can compare two languages and explain grammar rules better .
to sum up , I would argue that the best way to learn a language is to study it in your native country because you can always get the necessary help from your teachers .
moreover , today we have lots of opportunities to improve our skills such as communicating with English pen friends over the Internet .
I think that we should travel abroad so as to practise a language but not to study it .
